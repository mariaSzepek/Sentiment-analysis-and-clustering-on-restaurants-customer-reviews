Firstly, they didn't have the drink that I wanted. Secondly, they didn't have the main that I wanted but they did have my second choices. Dirty burger was nice and the rosemary chips were tasty, good food. Service was ok. Bit empty for a lunchtime. Would go back for the chips."
1;I went to Abacus for a team lunch. The venue was a lot better than I had remembered. The food was very good however the portions were a little small.
2;Abacus is better known as an after work bar and was almost empty at lunch time. Food is ok, but nothing special. We had a 50% off deal so it was very good value. Not sure i would go there without a special deal. Good relaxed place to meet up with friends in the city.
3;A well located venue for business lunches
4;"We were booked for 5:45pm for dinner in their dining area. The staff did not start their shift till 6pm which meant that we had to wait at the bar a bit before anybody knew where our table was. The staff at the bar weren't helpful at all and ignored my friend and me completely.

The menu is designed for nibbles and those are not too great. We ordered cocktails that weren't very alcoholic. I wouldn't go back for the food or cocktails but I suspect if you are out for a few beers/wines (things that they don't have to prepare) you might be ok."
5;"Abacus offers great value for money between Monday and Friday up to 8pm with half price platters and half price on all drinks. The kitchen did make a mistake with the food as we asked them not to put tomato products on the burgers due to an allergy but the manager was on hand to correct that. She even gave us a discount later on further drinks to make up for it. Abacus is a busy and popular place that does play loud chart music but good for relaxing with colleagues without a big price tag.
They do have an attendant in the toilets selling sweets and fragrances etc may make some people uncomfortable."
6;We arrived to be told they couldn't fit 10 people in & had called to advise us of this. I explained that I hadn't received any such call and was promptly told that the only table they had was 'other there' and the lady then walked off. The table in question was plenty big enough so we unfortuantely decided to stay as we assumed the service would improve - we were wrong. After 10 minutes we had to ask for menus and for our drinks order to be taken, the drinks arrived 20 minutes later after many requests & asking for our food orders to be taken. When the drinks finally arrived two of them were missing - they eventually arrived 5 minutes after the food arrived. I will not be eating at Abacus again until they change thier staff.
7;Prior to my lunch, I had previously visited Abacus for drinks with friends on a Friday night, which turned out to be a rather good evening indeed. My business lunch date suggested we eat here due to the close proximity to his office and I was a little hesitant as I know that the venue is mostly known for City folk drinking the evening away. As we arrived, much to my surprise, there was a distinct musky toilet smell as we walked in the door. I asked to be sat at the back of the venue (away from the smell) as not to embarrass my lunch date. The service was ok throughout, the food was reasonable (Tuna Nicoise) and the ambience awful. If Abacus are going to decide to do daytime food, they must improve the ambience & cleanliness of the venue.
8;Its not a restaurant its a run down pub. Decor jaded, furnature sticky, service slow and food better end of pub grub. Description on Toptable was misleading. This nplace looks like its used as a mass drinking pit in the evenings.
9;Restaurant was quiet but we had to ask the waiters to serve us, food took 45 mins ( city lunches usually need to be quicker ideally fit into 1 hr) mine was dreadful just a mozz and tom sandwich but had virtually no cheese so I had to send it back ( feeling dreadful about doing so ) . When it came back it did have some cheese but overall tasted pretty awful and just wasn't really nice . If I hadn't been with friends and had already complained I would have just left it . We then had to chase and chase to get the bill. On the positive the place was beautiful and when my chum said they should take off the admittedly small service charge they gave him 50% off food without him asking - must have known it was dreadful !
10;food is good quality and well price. For a easy lunch at good price not a bad location.
11;We had a mid-week lunch at Abacus, which must be the best value deal in the City, I had the Penne Arrabiata, a bargain £4 and it is a perfectly decent plate of pasta, spicy, not greasy and the pasta well cooked. My companion had a slightly more expensive chicken dish but absolutely fine. Our waiter was cheerful and the coffee was good. Plenty of space between the tables so good for a chat.
12;Good food and quick service, so convenient for city lunches.
13;A nice place, well located in the city, for quick lunches.
14;We had a quick lunch at Abacus, the quick service lunch is amazing value and I had the Penne Arrabiata for a bargain £4, My conmpanion had a club sandwich, both were absoluitely fine and the service was very cheerful. Perfect for a quick catch up lunch with friends and astonishingly good value for the City.
15;A conveniently-located city bar serving inexpensive lunch specials.
16;Wasnt overly impressed. having read reviews and checked it out online i thought i was going to get a lot of 'sizzle' for my money. Very big standard food which took a while to arrive then we waited ten minuted for a salad ordered at the same time as everything else. Three separate waiters took our drinks order and the quality of the food is very 'weatherspoons'
17;Met a business colleague at Abacus for a lunch meeting, only to find they had to have lunch with a client at their next meeting. Manager allowed us to still use table for a few drinks and our business meeting, very nice environment and very understanding given it was a 13:00 table.
18;Good central location perfect for quick business lunches.
19;"Abacus Bar is in a great location, close to Bank tube station and a short walk from rail services at Canon Street.

Usually a nightclub, they have a surprisingly good lunch menu with a wide array of choices. I had the steak salad and instead of a few shavings, I got a whole steak with rocket and mushrooms. It was very well cooked and seasoned and superb value.

For business lunches in the City, you could do a lot worse than pay a visit to Abacus - will definitely stop there again in the future."
20;Great for a quick lunch in the Square Mile. Good value too.
21;Service and food good, table a little shabby, needed replacing. Fab chocolate brownie.
22;Abacus is OK for few drinks, but as typical bar not much food options and cocktails are bit watery. Will go again if in location, but not really worth to make extra effort.
23;We enjoyed our meal here: quick service and good food.
24;We enjoyed the Express lunch at Abacus.
25;Great place for a quick yet relaxed lunch.
26;"Nice place for a quick business lunch; little less ""old school"" than similar venues, but that was fine with me and my lunching partner. Good choice of food, catered for dietary restriction with no hassles, and offered a lower price lunch menu as well. I'll be going back! :-)"
27;Lovely lunch venue.
28;Ideal place for a reasonable quick lunch.
29;Good lunch venue in the city.
30;Great place for a quick lunch with good ambience and fairly quick service.
31;Average.  Not particularly good food but it was cheap and quick.
32;Lunch at Abacus, London is fine for what it is. The food was good and served quickly which is important!
33;Abacus - average pub grub and service. OK for a quick bite but that's about it.
34;Great drinking but a very basic menu. `think if this place had some more meatier dishes on the menu then it could attract a lot more foodies.
35;Great place to meet the girlies after work for some good food, good drinks & atmosphere.
36;Great place to meet the girlies after work for some good food, good drinks & atmosphere.
37;Greay atmosphere - met up for a girly meal, lovely cocktails, good set-up. A bit noisy but we liked it! Food was ok, good vareity on the menu and quick service.

39;"I had the posh fish finger sandwich. I was rather disappointed with it as it seemed to be more bread than anything else. Not enough fish fingers!
Also we had a draft coming in from the front door which was left open on a cool damp day. Not sure I will bother going here again."

41;Burgers were really good and perfect size for lunch. Good chips too. Recommend as a spot near Bank station with plenty of space and a lively atmosphere. We asked if the music could be turned down as it was lunchtime and it was too loud, and they obliged.
42;We had a lovely meal at Abacus in London. I chose the stilton salad and my buddy had risotto followed by eton mess. The bill was good value at £20. We'll be back.
43;I had caesar salad with chicken which was OK. Chicken was a bit on the dry side.  I had the Eaton mess for dessert. This was rather disappointing for £5M. Very sweet, squirty cream used so not good.
44;Abacus is perfect for a group booking to have some fun and some tasty bar food - great for sharing. Staff were very attentive and it was great to be able to go and have a dance straight after our meal!
45;awesome
46;nice food and cocktails
47;Very standard pre-made pub food. Not overly impressed. Several items on menu not available as apparently the 'menu was in process of being updated'.
48;great
49;Decent quality bar food with a good selection. Nothing special but a lot better than most pubs.

didnt think much to the rustic platter we had, not enough of it."
59;Excellent food and service. I use it regularly now as a great venue in the heart of the city..
60;Abacus in the heart of the City of London was a great venue for a team lunch.  The service was attentive, but not tto much.  It gets very lively and lound in the  evening, but for lunchtime it was ideal
61;Great place as always,  food is above average but not amazing.  Service was good and the place has always got a good vibe.
62;Nice modern venue, pleasant service and lots of menu choice. Only criticism was that my burger and fries came on a board with the chips in a bowl and it wasn't that easy to eat....Will go again
63;"As always food was fine, nothing to write home about, however I have noticed some new staff and the servicde is definitely much improved.

Again the Tastecard make this place a non-brainer"
64;Location of our table could have been better but service, food and wine was fine and value for money in this part of the city.
65;"Abacus, Cornhill, London 24Aug
All day breakfast was great."
66;Had lunch at Abacus in Cornhill, London, food and service were generally good however the chicken burger that my lunch buddy had was a bit too char grilled and verging on burnt.
67;Simple but reasonable food
68;"Abacus in London is a great place for a quick decent meal.
The service was swift and friendly and the atmosphere was lively
All in all, good value for money"
69;Abacus, London was an OK experience.  Just an OK one.  It took forever to get served - the waiters and waitresses were very inattentive.  Food was average - nothing to write home about.  Wouldn't go back.
70;The lunchtime food is surprisingly good for a bar that gets so crowded by night. Good value for friends and business people on a tighter budget.
71;Great food at Abacus in London and such good value. The chicken wrap was delicious and the mojitos were great! Service was a bit haphazard. I was asked did I want dessert when I still had over half my main meal in front of me, but all in all a good experience.
72;Abacus in London is a great place for a casual Friday lunch with a very reasonably priced menu. Avoid the prawn sandwich - was expecting lush king prawns and got tiny baby prawns. Not nice at all. Dessert was lovely though - sticky toffy pudding!
73;Great for lunch with mates.  Straightforward and good menu, reasonably priced.  However the basement area is v. dark, which is not really ideal for lunchtimes!
74;Lunch at Abacus offfers decent vlaue and decent lunch grub... difficult to look away from the burgers...
75;"Service was with a smile and very charming, but i think they were a little short staffed.
Food was good value and my guest's fish cakes were very nice, but my pie and mash was too salty for me. 
Overall though is was excellent value as we had two meals and a bottle of wine for £24 and we will definitely be back!"
76;We chose Abacus with its central city location for one of our boys lunches. It suited us admirably. A secluded area so we could enjoy the banter and a very attentive waitress who kept the wine flowing. The food is good pub food - a step up from All Bar One but no pretentiousness. We will definitely return.
77;"Abacus on Cornhill provides a wide and reasonably priced menu with nice friendly staff.

Not a Conran but good for run of the mill food with low prices in the City."
78;Abacus was great , cant really fault for a lunch with friends.
79;Lunch at Abacus was very pleasant.  Service is swift and it is value for money for the City.
80;abacus was lovely as always, a good option for  lunch.
81;Good food, atmosphere and location makes the Abacus a great lunch time venue. Only downside is the service can be a little slow therefore make sure you dont need to rush back.
82;Abacus - reliable and tasty as ever for lunch!
83;Nice place to and meet friends for lunch.  Menu good value.
84;Would highly recommend the Abacus as a lunch time venue. I have been a couple of times now and each time both food and service have been great.
85;Went to Abacus for lunch and found it a thoroughly pleasant experience. Service is excellent, the tables are comfortable, the ambiance welcoming. My friend really liked the fishcakes. I had pasta with veg - a little greasy but a very generous portion. Shared salad was very good. Small selection of wines by the glass but there's something for everyone in it. Food was served promptly. We'll be going back, but I'll be ordering something else.
86;Abacus had a welcoming, pleasant atmosphere. Food was tasty and reasonably priced.  Yummy Italian/greek choices. The service was great and nothing too much trouble. Nice wine list. Definately would return if in area.
87;Abacus is a lovely place to go for lunch, I recommend the Lamb burgers - the feta salad is yummy!
88;I was pleasantly surprised by the Abacus. I have normally just been there at the end of a long evening however went there for a lunch. Really pleasant atmosphere, the foods was great and very reasonable. Would highly recommend.
89;Meal was nice, average food for lunch that does the trick, nice atmosphere.
90;Although Abacus is a lovely venue for a quick lunch, on this occasion, our table was not reserved so we ended up sitting at the door which was rather baltic!
91;Abacus is a great place for an after work drink and some bar snacks. Their 50% off food and drink offer is well worth it, just make sure you dont order before 7pm when the offer starts!
92;The food, atmophere and service is always the same in Abacus, very good and extremely good value for money.
93;I went to Abacus for lunch today and had the Fish Cakes and Chips, which was lovely, filling but not overly filling.  My friend had the Salmon and Asparagus salad (which she has had many times now) and very much enjoyed it.  The food is great, the service is great and the atmopshere is perfect for a lunch setting.
94;Abacus - Poor and very slow service for a lunch time and they got our food orders wrong. Service was so slow we waited 10 minutes to order and then another 30-35 minutes to get the food - we were on an hour lunch break and we ran well over and then the food was wrong. Awful.
95;Abacus- excellent service, food was good, half price makes it really worth it. Great ambience.
96;Abacus is a great spot - for a cheap lunch in nice surrpundings and also for a boogy as it gets dark! Food is surprisingly cheap for a City spot and it makes a great place to get together with colleagues and friends alike. Never disappoints.
97;Went to Abacus on 8 January, received good service and food as always.  Although the Chicken Burger was a little tough on this occassion.
98;I went to Abacus for lunch and the food was good as was the service.  I am a regularly visitor of this restaurant and am rarely dissapointed.
99;I had lunch at Abacus on Friday (always a nice busy atmosphere on a Friday).  I had the Chicken Burger, which I have had before - good comfort food.  My friend has the Salmon salad which was also very nice.
100;I had lunch today at Abacus with a friend (I have been here on a couple of occassions).  I had the chicken burger, which was delicious.  It's a little pricey for a burger, but if you are a burger fanatic like me then you wont mind paying that bit extra.  The prices are very good here for dinner, but I do find they can be rather expensive for a lunch around £10 a head.  All in all a good meal.
101;Abacus was pretty quiet on a monday night, and the restaurant area was part of the main bar, however the food was good and there were good offers on wine and champagne, however a little lacking in atmosphere
102;Abacus, as always, easily hits the afterwork spot. Food was fine, but it's only really required to soak up the sweet cocktails. Whole crew had a good laugh.
103;An old favourite of mine. Great surrounds and perfect city location - right next to the Royal Exchange. Service was lacking a bit once it got busy but the food is tasty and is good value for a city location. Definitely recommended.
104;Abacus was great for after work drinks and nibbles. Great happy hour deals, and lovely table areas in the bar downstairs.
105;Brilliant lunch, good quick service and yummy food.
106;Abacus normally has pretty good service but today was not so good - 25mins to get a drink and on a lunch hour - it's not that impressive.  But good food and atmoshphere.  Would still recommend.
107;Food at Abacus was nice. Better than standard pub fare and excellent value for money.
108;We arrived at Abacus on a Friday evening and the bar was very busy with quite a rowdy group. Our table had been placed right next to the bar, far from ideal. Though when we aske dot be moved to a quieter corner things improved. We found the service to be friendly, though our drinks orders were initially forgotten about, we recieved an apology when they finally arrived. Great place if you want to go to the club afterward. Not recommended for a quiet drink on a Friday night. Would go back.
109;Abacus is ideally an evening joint in my opinion but still a good lunch location for fine service and good choice of food. Middle of the City which is handy.
110;Abacus definitely has a rep as a City bar and also meat market, but we went rather early, perched ourselves on comfy high seating and ordered your standard fare. Food was good standard but nothing special. Waitress was nice/friendly/smiley. A good stop off point for the evening.
111;Abacus - service was terrible! It took 1hour 20 and 6 trips to the bar before our 2 platters of food finally got delivered to our table! Nice ambiance though and happy hour prices are pretty good. Wouldn't rush back, at all.
112;We went to Abacus as a large group on a Friday evening to celebrate a birthday - staff were helpful although our table was slightly nearer to the toilets than we would ideally have liked. Food and drink was good quality and very reasonably priced. Great for a Friday night and hitting the downstairs club afterwards so a good night was had by all!
113;Think chef has changed since last year as food not as good. Dishes came out at different times so most were cold before we all started to eat. Serving everyone together is a fundamental requirement of a large group and we expect this in a professional establishment.  Staff did their best in the circumstances, were really sweet and helpful so not a criticism of them but more a management issue.  In spite of repeated pre-contact with booking staff they still failed to have wine on table on arrival
114;Abacus didn't have enough bar staff so sevice was slow. They also had problems with our food order which we faxed in advance, so no food had been prepared for our party! These problems were slowly fixed though and then night ended up alright!
115;Abacus, quite simply, made me look good when I booked it as the venue for our company's annual Christmas lunch. It did this by supplying exemplary service, always with a friendly smile, by providing a cosy, well-laid out area when I asked 'for something special' and nothing appeared to be too much trouble for the cool, attentive staff. I would definitely recommend this venue. Other bonuses: Bank station is just around the corner and great for after work drinks too - Thanks Abacus!
116;I don't know many people that go to Abacus to eat. Especially not on a Thursday night. The nibbles were sufficient, but it's all about the happy hour jugs of cocktails, followed by a light-hearted boogie on the dancefloor.
117;I had a lovely birthday celebration at Abacus with my work colleagues and it's a relief to know you can reserve a nice comfy area to yourself.  Took advantage of Happy Hour to buy some champagne so not too costly for a birthday! Great place and staff charming, if a bit overworked - they need more!
118;Abacus is a great place to go for a group lunch its is reasonably priced and the food is good.
119;Abacus We enjoyed our meal at and thought it was good value for money. The areas they need to improve would be service and to ensure they have most things on the menu. We ordered 3 different desserts but they only had one dessert in stock. We also chose 2 bottles wines and niether were in stock.
120;Essentially pub grub - all deep fried, pump it out fastt food. Would not be one I'd recommend.
121;Had work leaving do there and was v. impressed with customer service. Good news for the girls - there are loads of city men there on a Thursday!  Music got a bid dodgy later on but then I hate R&B!
122;Don't go for a meal! Nibbles and platters are good for lining the stomach, but it's all about the drinks here. Not as lively on a Wed night, but Thurs & Fri rock for happy hour cocktails.
123;The place is modern, good cocktail list, food menu is very cheap, good value for money. The club downstairs is a meat market....
