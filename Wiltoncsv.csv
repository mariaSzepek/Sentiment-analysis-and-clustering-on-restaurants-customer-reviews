0;Splendid  as always
1;Always a joy to return to Wiltons. Impeccable all round. Looking forward to returning.
2;Simply perfect in every way. Service food, wine and setting
3;We really enjoyed dining here and look forward to coming again. We liked the traditional, elegant style of the dining room. The service from everyone was exceptional, very warm and professional, and explanations of the dishes were good. The food was excellent. To start with we had the lobster bisque and smoked trout, which were both full of flavour. We both had the pheasant, which came well recommended and deservedly so, it was fabulous. We followed this by the apricot soufflés, one of our favourite desserts. The wines as recommended by the sommelier were also very good. We had coffee and tea afterwards, served in silver teapots, accompanied by petit fours, a big plus to have filter coffee available on the menu!Excellent from start to finish, we recommend!
4;Exceptional from start to finish. Personable and professional front of house staff  very friendly and knowledgeable, fabulous food, terrific wines. The Oysters and lobster were out of this world. Highly recommended.
5;My wife’s birthday
6;The service attention plus the food and wine selection exceeded our expectations. The cooking method is French with heavy sauce onto British cuisine. Starters: We love the Blue Silton soufflé, the game terrine and freshness of langoustine. For main, the pheasant and venison were cooked to perfection. Missing the fat cut British chips as more like French fries. PS: all the men worn suits even thou not specify! So do dress up.
7;Probably one of the best ambience in London, it’s quiet, comfortable, mood lighting and carpet that absorbs noise. The customers frequenting Wiltons appear to adhere to an unwritten code of good behaviour, jackets and ties for a vast majority of men and women look smart. The food is generally very good although this time my lamb cutlets were fatty and over-cooked, the Stilton cheese soufflé was nice but needed more flavour but nicely risen, the crumble was excellent. This is a superb venue and although rightly so, is certainly on the verge of over-pricing.
8;Lovely food and the finest service anywhere.
9;Service was impeccable and overall a really great evening. Particularly good for taking out family or out of town-ers
10;Lovely relaxed late lunch and a spot of West End shopping afterwards
11;Charming,efficient and helpful  staff, beautifully presented food and a great wine list in a lovely restrained English atmosphere, what more could you want .
12;A classic. Attentive service, fresh food prepared to perfection and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxing.
13;An absolute pleasure to dine here. This was our third visit and now a firm favourite. Everything from food to service is exemplary. The menu is varied and beautifully prepared and presented. Lovely staff and a fabulous quintessentially British atmosphere. Just divine.
14;Excellent as always
15;Had a delicious meal - very traditional British.  So enjoyed it! Will definitely come again when  visiting London
16;First of all, I have been told that this restaurant is apparently currently being targeted by “fraudsters”, according to Wiltons, who are working with the Information Commissioner’s Office to resolve this issue. These alleged fraudsters managed to get hold of the details of my restaurant booking (which I had made through OpenTable), and call me in order to obtain my card details, in order for them to spend on my card by saying that they needed a deposit to secure my restaurant booking. As a result I had to cancel the card before I’d even got to Wiltons. Despite the restaurant knowing this before I got there to celebrate my birthday, no one apologised to me on my arrival for any inconvenience caused and they declined to give us the kind of table we requested. Beyond this disappointing start to the evening, I must say that the service and the food were excellent. The soufflé, the oysters, the lobster Thermidor and Newberg, were all fantastic. For dessert I had the crumble and my girlfriend had the strawberry soufflé with pistachio ice cream. Again these were top notch. The restaurant laid on a small treat for my birthday at the end of the meal which was much appreciated. The atmosphere was cheerful and nowhere near as stuffy as I had feared. I had feared that the old-school reputation of Wiltons might mean substandard food - but not a bit of it. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it all was. So I’ll definitely be back at some stage, but I won’t be laying out any deposits for tables next time!
17;Excellent as always
18;Fantastic as always
19;A lovely meal, a stilton soufflé to die for! What a lovely place, one of our new favourites I think!
20;Had a fab lunch at Wiltons - a very traditional British restaurant.  The food was delicious and I had apple crumble and custard.  I will come back again
21;Absolutely splendid My favourite London Restaurant Excellent food Exceptional staff
22;A lovely traditional venue with great history.  Superb quality of food and service.
23;Fantastic atmospheric restaurant serving wonderful fresh seafood. Staff so cheerful & helpful, even with current restrictions, and no idea what the future holds for their jobs. Place was full and deservedly so.
24;Ask for a booth. My soup was awful so returned it.  Fish excellent...I thought the menu of the day could have been more interesting...not imaginative cooking...a bit dated.
25;Amazing service and food, my second time visiting Wiltons and I absolutely love it!
26;Great food in a fantastic old British setting. Oysters were excellent and Gouse perfectly cooked
27;Amazing food - best lobster thermidor - really nice people and great serivce
28;Very good evening spoiled by the 10.00pm curfew.Shame
29;Absolutely marvellous !
30;Love the fish/oystersGood for wheelchair users in terms of access
31;Wilson’s never disappoints!
32;One of the top ten restaurants in London  back there in November fine dining at its best
33;Fabulous place with amazing (sea)food, attentive staff and great atmosphere. I have dined here a few times before and even after being reopened for only 2 weeks after 6 months of being closed I could not tell any difference. Amazing. I will definitely be back soon! Thank you!
34;Excellent food which was perfectly presented. All members of staff were welcoming & friendly. Operating a good social distancing policy & i would happily recommend Wiltons. I will certainly be returning.
35;Excellent food and service. Rather warm room that became uncomfortably so in the last third of the meal. AirCon eventually turned on as we were leaving. Probably just a snafu due to it being the first evening sitting following lock down. Would strongly recommend
36;Fantastic lunch for my father’s 89th birthday.  Impeccable service, very attentive, they heard it was my father’s birthday and prepared for him a little cake without us asking!!   The lunch was lovely, and its a perfect restaurant for a special lunch.
37;Amazing experience! Delicious food! The baked Bishop Stilton Soufflé is worth coming back for more!  We had a birthday lunch and were given a very romantic table (in the booth). The staff was very attentive, welcoming and not intrusive. The food was absolutely delicious! Scallops, Lemon Sole, the Soufflé, Black halibut - everything was cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back!
38;One of our dining club’s best experiences....superb service, delightful surroundings and amazing food - one of the best fish restaurants we have been to.
39;Food 10 out of 10
40;Supreme amongst high quality traditional fish-with impeccable service.Impossible to beat at this level or quality in a beautiful and calm setting.Outstanding as always
41;Buzzy atmosphere, perfectly cooked food and attentive service.
42;Xlnt to 10th degree!
43;Wonderful atmosphere! Elegant place. Excellent food
44;The welcome, service, and ambience is quite simply generous and faultless. The multitude of staff acknowledge everyone. I started with twice baked Cropwell Bishop souffle, and continued with roasted skate wing with butter and capers. All delicious. I was not drinking alcohol for January, so settled for fizzy water. I have eaten at Wiltons many times, and have enjoyed every visit. My only criticism is the awful creamed potatoes (mash), which I have complained about on every visit. They cream the potatoes using a food processor, which results in a thick wallpaper paste consistency. Dreadful. They claim there is no time to do it differently. I will still visit regularly (if not banned) but will avoid the awful spuds
45;Great venue classic food with great service
46;Went for the seasonal menu, which is brilliant. Started with a nice glass of champagne, then had half dozen oysters followed by lemon sole and finished with the dessert. Worth every single penny! Highly recommended!
47;Wilton’s lives up to it’s reputation. Excellent service, very nice food and good choice on the set menu. Wine is quite expensive however would go back again.
48;I have always wanted to eat here but had not been able to afford it so was very glad to see there was a deal! Managed to find a bottle of wine just under £40 which was a relief.Food and service was faultless . We sat in a booth which was great for a catch up - we could hear each other easily.Great menu, vast wine list. Excellent experience all round I would happily recommend Wilton’s.
49;Great food and attentive service in typically English surroundings. Fully recommend.
50;Wilton's is perfect. A civilized place in an uncivilized world.
51;Food was a bit salty otherwise good
52;Terrific service, food and wine list  a joy to dine there.  Joe Cari New York
53;Yet again a happy, delicious memorable time was had by all.  Langoustines, Cheese soufflé, lamb cutlets & anchovies on toast were all absolute perfection,  We drank just as well too,  Nowhere could be better
54;We had an absolutely wonderful dinner at Wilton's from start to finish.  The service was impeccable and the Dover Sole was amazing.  We also loved the ambiance - so nice to be able to hear one another and enjoy nice conversation over a meal without the usual noise that most restaurants have now.  We will definitely return to Wiltons every time we are in London.
55;Wiltons was an oasis of calm and cosseting--the service was impeccable without being intrusive and the food was outstanding (Stilton shuffle, Dover sole)--for the quality, the price was spot on.  We can't wait for the opportunity to return.
56;Nice old-school atmosphere and excellent service. Not rushed. Rather pricey, even for this part of town, however.
57;Beautiful place with exceptional service and food. The sommelier was a gem leading us to a unique wine that was delicious. Awesome oysters and diver sole veronique terrific
58;As always, the service and food, as well as the wine selection, was excellent.
59;This is an amazing establishment. So British. The service and food were outstanding.  We had the Stilton soufflé appetizer and it was one of the best things we’ve ever had.
60;It’s a high end very “British” restaurant.
61;We went to Wiltons as they had a very good offer on through Open  Table.  It was great to experience a restaurant of this quality at a reasonable price.  We will go again!
62;Superb as ever.Tradition and style
63;We have dined at Wiltons for over a decade. Our most recent meal was exceptional fromstart to finish. We could easily dine here each night of our stay.  The smoked salmon,the soups, fish and lamb were perfect.  It is a busy kitchen, but we given time to enjoyour dinner without staff looking at the clock. The bar staff, the wait staff, etc. I neededa non-dairy emphasis, and my dishes were seasoned and finished with care.

65;Kind courteous attentive friendly team gave us the most lovely time anyone could wish for. As ever, the food was delicious. Langoustines, eel, lamb etc all of the very best quality and cooked to absolute perfection
66;Our first visit to Wiltons, a very nice restaurant, very good service, and the staff were very attentive. Very nice food, prepared and served well. A very good evening.
67;The food was average. The ambiance ok. But the service left a lot to be desired. There was a constant feeling of being rushed. Worst of all was the way the sommelier asked my guest what she would like to drink. Instead of a general question, she asked if my guest wanted a glass of champagne or a kir royale. Such up-selling is tiresome and puts the host in an awkward situation and the guest who had only just arrived, being forced to chose one or the other. Please stop this practice. And when you have, let me know and I may return. Otherwise I won’t.
68;We had a spectacular dining experience to celebrate our week in London. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for outstanding seafood and excellent service.
69;Very good as usualBut as a regular would have appreciated to have a nicer table
70;Perfect. Best British food Restaurant
71;Old England elegance
72;Wilton’s is extraordinary. It provides the very best time after time. The best ingredients, cooked with apparent simplicity & ease, to produce the most delicious food. Swift, friendly service from a team of knowledgeable staff who are keen to ensure every customer has a great experience. Good seating, lighting and acoustics- sadly often lacking in many other establishments that consider themselves equal. A proper restaurant  for those who appreciate the best
73;Food was dreadful but a lovely place. Staff were attentive
74;The food and service were both fantastic. I think this was one of the best meal experiences I have had in a very long time. I can’t wait to go back!
75;Perfect venue for lunch in Jermyn Street. The carving trolley is a highlight.
76;Amazing service and dinner - we had a wonderful time on our anniversary
77;Just outstanding food and service.  Wonderful ambiance!
78;We had a most enjoyable lunch.The atmosphere  was relaxed and our table was in an area where you could talk  without having to raise your voice,  which for me is important. The service was good and so was the food. We particularly liked the cheese soufle and the desert which was delicious. Tha main course was  OK, but not exceptional.
79;Fine dining at it's very best. We never eaten at such an elegant restaurant.
80;I have already reviewed Wilton’s recently, and can confirm that this is a quality restaurant with understated class.
81;Exceptional food. Impeccable service. Everything you would expect from a London institution.
82;wilton’s staff and food are the epitome of excellence. simply the best restaurant for classic European food. It never fails to reward. the experience is always enjoyable and fun.
83;"Disappointing – off the listAt Wilton’s again to host a friend from the US for lunch.  All seemed to go well at first, a bright, breezy reception, a nice booth (albeit very close to another table) and seemingly interested staff.But the process was not relaxed with some urgency from the staff to get orders in, particularly drinks.  It felt a little like a fast food outlet.  The first course was unremarkable – my smoked salmon was thin to the point of transparency.The main course was poor. A “medium” filet steak came almost well done.  The lead waiter acknowledged this and suggested starting both meals all over again.  My guest had started his Dover sole, but we reluctantly accepted the solution and the inevitable delay.The replacement steak was little better.  Yes, it was no longer well done, but clearly the quality of the meat was not the best.  At this point I was more concerned to enjoy the conversation with my visiting friend than have further negotiations.The flow of the meal had been ruined and it over-ran.  My guest had to leave for another appointment, and I remained to pay the bill.  There was no one “on duty” as I left the table – in fact there were no staff visible except the coat assistant and a junior barman who was bantering with her.  It was like leaving a deserted ship.It’s a shame that Wilton’s has lost its edge – the meal was a disappointment, the service rushed and anxious – not the professional, relaxed atmosphere of a supposedly leading restaurant.I appreciate that the Wilton’s brand is heavily marketed, but the reality is that it does not deliver at its price point; I would hate visitors to London to be disappointed. Also, some of the tables are very close together.Wilton’s is now off my list of London restaurants for now and I would recommend others to look elsewhere."
84;Great food as usual but given a very poor table in the restaurant corridor. Was moved to a different table but again a very cramped position.
85;Wilton's is just wonderful - such a class act on all levels.
86;We were greeted by a warm and welcoming gentleman who took care of our coats in a very professional manner. The food quality is very high, and the wine list excellent.There were no scallops on that night, which came as a surprise for such an reputable seafood restaurant. Overall the service was perfect, with the notable exception of our  main waiter, whose slightly aggressive tone and manners was totally out of place in such an environment.
87;Nice restaurant on Jermyn street. Typical English food and service- a good thing, with subdued noise. The food was excellent as was the service.
88;An absolute gem of a restaurant for great food and wonderful personal service.
89;Excellent food and service. Expensive, but well worth the money.
90;It’s a wholly civilised and cultured experience. The servers are appropriately attentive and amenable.It’s also reassuringly expensive and worth every penny.
91;Outstanding. My favourite restaurant in London. We will be back. Thank you.
92;Was pleasantly surprised seeing that most restaurant’s customers respected a dress-code. A quality place to invite business partners or family and friends to. Not cheap but this brings certain clientele. The only thing missing for me was no music. Some quiet relaxed jazz (Marc Johnson, for example) at the background would be nice and suitable for this venue. Food was delicious and they have a good choice of wines.
93;Wilton's is always a pleasure to dine with. Their service, food and atmosphere is impeccable.
94;Service that went above and beyond, lovely wait staff, fab food, all served with old school charm and flair! We had a great night, it was my first visit and it certainly won’t be the last...thank you!
95;If  I had to dine at just one restaurant anywhere in the world for ever more it would be Wiltons.
96;This is just a fun place to eat, if you are looking for an old-school experience. Great staff, good food and beautiful restaurant.  We really enjoyed ourselves.
97;Thoroughly enjoyed the evening! Will recommend to anyone!
98;The beef Wellington and Dover sole were truly special and the service outstanding. A memorable dining experience.
99;The best restaurant in London without question. Impeccable service in the best tradition, only possible in an establishment owned by bankers who presumably don't expect it to be a major profit centre.
100;Very nice evening in a restaurant that makes you feel part of history: 277 years. Hopefully many years still to come. Btw great food, attentive staff, nice wine.
101;Wilton’s is THE British restaurant. The service and food are terrific and it’s always nice to be dining where everyone dresses properly
102;Great food and atmosphere! Really love this place!
103;Wilton’s was a classic restaurant with great seafood and service.  The wine list was extensive and the fish was the best in town.
104;Wiltons always delivers. The best restaurant in the world? I do not know, but the best I have been to...ever. First time with my father many, many years ago, and still the same quality. in fact we had a great lunch, had a brief rest and went back for oysters for dinner...
105;As usual Wilton’s hospitality and food quality is second to none.  I love this restaurant and consider it the best restaurant in London.
106;Top class. Best service. Classic english food. Nothing better than wiltons
107;The Wilton’s experience is unparalleled! Immaculate service is the norm so this visit was slightly disappointing in that we had to call the waiter a couple of times.Food was excellent but the menu was more limited than I remembered.Still a great treat.
108;We arrived early for a pre theatre dinner. We were welcomed, led to the bar and offered a drink. The menus appeared, and explanations offered.My partner asked about the dove sole, but chose the plaice. I chose smoked salmon  (delicious) , from  the winter menu, followed by a meaty and excellent skate served with crunchy topping of spring onions lemon and herbs.Ultimately we were told that the plaice was not available, but the very efficient and charming head waiter offered fried filets of Dover sole, instead. With chips and some spinach,, we enjoyed a real treat.I had a glass of Sancerre, whilst my partner took a glass of the house Chablis:crisp flinty and flavoursome.We refused dessert, but enjoyed the chocolate truffles for a little sweet taste at the end of a very pleasant meal. Although we needed to be finished and ready to leave by 6.50pm, were never felt to be rushed, the  waiter merely asking when we arrived if we were going to the theatre that evening.
109;Great fish, very well prepared, presentation is excellent, service is perfect
110;The stilton soufflé was amazing. a very special place with fantastic service...
111;Very good, old school experience. We really enjoyed the food. Lovely (vegan) mushroom and ale pie. We also loved the good choice of vegetable side orders.
112;Valentines Day evening meal at Wiltons. First time eating here and had an outstanding time. The food and service was second to none. Will definitely be adding this to the list to return to in the future and would highly recommend if you have not been before.
113;Outstanding Perfect meal in a fabulous setting in a great restaurant
114;Disappointed overall with Wiltons. Very buzzy atmosphere but food wasn't as good as hoped. Service veru good and friendly. Very expensive for the quality of food
115;Phenomenal food, phenomenal staff, simply great.  Thank you.
116;We had a great night at Wilton’s. They really understand that they are in the hospitality business and the whole experience reflected that. The Food was very good, the service excellent.
117;Wonderful experience will definitely be back and certainly would recommend.
118;Superb service, good atmosphere and excellent food
119;An understated elegant dining Romney with superb service and wonderfully prepared food. Not a lot more to say really, except I’ll return soon..
120;Important dinner for me, joined by senior leadership of our firm and top customers. Thanks to the staff. They were all fantastic. Superb service and all smiles. Tip of the hat to the manager for selecting and developing a great team.  I'll be back when I next return to London.  All the best.
121;Wiltons is what it is. I would go there every day if I could afford to. Nearly everything was perfect ….the oysters, the plaice the Swiss wine Petite Arvine (very difficult to find this one). Top marks all round.
122;"Second visit, fantastic as the first time, English, cosy, relaxing place , service, ""assiette"" delicious....Continuity...... GREAT....."
123;Never fails - always excellent and over many years, I’ve never been disappointed!
124;The Honey glazed gammon from carving trolly was to die for!!
125;Perfect dinner, delicious cocktails, lovely service.  Amazing all around.
126;Wilton’s is expensive as it should be given its location and quality. We go because of the traditional English food, and particularly the fish. Also because it’s very civilised experience (unless you’re on one of the tables jammed in the aisles. They really should be removed even though it does mean the loss of some covers.) We we’re fortunate enough to have been given a lovely quiet, comfortable booth.On this visit, the potted shrimps, large Dover soles, creamed spinach, female sommelier-recommended St Aubin, crème brûlée, and coffee, salted caramel and vanilla ice creams, were all marvellous. Service was efficient and sweet. The only duds were a deconstructed prawn cocktail that had obviously been formed in a large pastry cutter. They should leave this nonsense to lesser restaurants. We all know what a good prawn cocktail should look like, and contain, namely a wide glass layered with a chiffonade of lettuce, a good heap of hand-peeled North Atlantic prawns - not tiger prawns - all napped with a proper Marie-rose sauce. A garnish of lemon and/or cucumber and a dash of cayenne are acceptable. The small loaf of bread looked great but was also disappointing, being a bit stale.With two glasses of decent house champagne and two whisky sours the bill was £350 including service. A lot for two but it was our Christmas present to ourselves and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening.
127;Exquisite food, always excited to come to this wonderful London institution. Calm, grown up and posh but in such an understated way.
128;Quintessential British and that’s why I like it. Remains traditional and maintains high standards
129;Wiltons is wonderful I love it, long may it remain exactly like it is, I love the tablecloths if only more restaurants had tablecloths and the organisation and service is great as is the food and wine list- I never want it to modernise I hate modern restaurants I like character and heart abd soul
130;The place to enjoy a civil lunch or dinner with close friends and family with the trimmings of excellency More of the same to come I hope
131;"My first attempt to book a table at Wilton's failed: it was closed for renovations for a  long period. I was booking at the suggestion of my guest, Sir Ian Moncrieffe of that Ilk, and the time was nearly 30 years ago. Sir Ian particularly liked Wilton's ""because it is the only smart London restaurants that has waitresses, and they remind me of my nanny.""  The waitresses seem now to have been replaced with young, eager and caring young men, but there are some notably comely young women helping them. The food is always superb. My host ordered plaice, a fish I normally disdain, feeling life is too brief to eat plaice or lemon sole. I was proved wrong by Wilton's plaice meunière. My own Loch Duart oysters were spectacular, huge, firm and brinily delicious. Our bottle of house Chablis was a bargain at £49. Despite the several tables of very young lovers (how could they afford Wilton's?), this is still the place for gentlemen to enjoy each others' company, superb food, and the best service in London."
132;Always a pleasure.
133;Wiltons is as usual a unique place in London, a first class British restaurant with a marvellous acoustics which makes it possible for a quiet conversation the whole evening. The food is excellent, especially the sea food and the oysters. I simply love the place.
134;Locale che ha una lunga storia, ma non aperto alle esigenze dei clienti. Materia prima ottima, ma cucina non curata all’altezza del prezzo.
135;The most classic of classic London Restaurants, one to be enjoyed and savoured.
136;Excellent in every way. The food was perfectly cooked. The ingredients of excellent quality. The staff friendly and very professional. This restaurant is a very special place, probably the best dining experience I have had.  Quality through and through. Thank you.
137;An excellent experience, I could not fault any aspect of it. I have been visiting for years and will continue to do so.
138;It could not have been better.  Food, wine, service: all of the highest standards
139;Great food , the Lobster Newburg especially. Nice table and service was ok on the whole. Did not get the wine list until asking and therefore a long delay between aperitifs and getting another drink. Despite that very good all round
140;Simply outstanding from start to finish - a wonderful family dinner, great service and delicious food! Expensive but worth every penny.
141;Best fish restaurant in London.
142;Excellent as ever. Oysters first class and both dover sole and turbot outstanding. Good service from sommelier as always.
143;It was my fifth time at Wilton’s. The food was as good as always but the service was poor. This was surprising since I’ve always been happy with the service previously. We had to ask for menues and it was hard to get the attention of the waitors. After discussing this with one of the waitors the service improved but it was still not great.
144;I looked for a true British experience and I fully reached my target. Very attractive menu with a variety of oysters, seafood and game. The ambiance is stylish but friendly and easy at the same time. Service simply excellent. I had a fantastic selection of oysters and a roasted pheasant like a typical Christmas proposal. Indeed the pheasant was slightly tough but this has really been the only point of improvement. All the rest deserved __rating. It will be one of my preferite stops in the future.
145;A fantastic traditional restaurant, such a find. Look forward to returning on my next visit to London.
146;Went with my fiancee for lunch. We chose the Seasonal menu which was the cheaper option but still outstanding value. We both went for the two course option with my fiancee going for the salmon starter which was plentiful and exquisite. We both went for the roast beef (Wednesday) which was melt in the mouth tender, roast potatoes come with it. We had some sprouts which are a bit pricey at £6.00 for the portion. We shared a date and walnut steamed pudding which was delicious. All this was washed down with a bottle of muscadet which was one of the cheaper options on the extensive wine list. The service was spot on and I would like to thank Michael Stokes for taking time to tell us about the history of the restaurant. First class !
147;The perfect English restaurant! Excellent food and service exquisite ambiance and environment.
148;The highest quality nostalgic cooking in surroundings to matchFabulous
149;Almost to much service...if there is such a thing.
150;My Wilton’s experience was superlative in every imaginable way. The food was exquisite.  The service was impeccable. The ambiance was unsurpassed.  I have no more over-the-top adjectives to describe it.
151;Wilton's is the gold standard for all other London restaurants.  It is always wonderful....
152;Consistent top notch food and service. Not innovative, not pretentious, not Michelin 3 star, but always excellent and pleasing. 100% reliable.
153;Always a wonderful enjoyment and a feeling of relaxation . We are seated and we give a big sigh and sit back and enjoy the experience.
154;An old favourite which disappointed us a little on this occasion. Known for the most attentive service amongst London restaurants we felt a bit neglected on this occasion. The food was not quite up to standard and  the size and presentation of the sole was less good than usual with some bones which had been overlooked. The grouse had been cut up when the request was for it to be whole.  None of these elements spoilt our evening but when you are paying Wiltons prices you expect the very best!
155;Excellent food and service but a little pricey. Wonderful atmosphere
156;Wonderful service, great British atmosphere  and excellent food.
157;Wiltons est une des plus belles adresses de Londres: un accueil très courtois, un décor élégant et reposant, un service discret, efficace et très professionnel et une cuisine d'un grand classicisme mais d'une extrême qualité. La sole de Douvres est un délice, même très légèrement trop cuite, présentée avec une sauce tartare exquise. la carte des vins est d'une grande richesse et offre un panorama passionnant.Certes, tout cela a un prix assez élevé mais en rapport avec la qualité du restaurant que je souhaite aux gourmets de découvrir et qui laisse un excellent souvenir.jean michel barate
158;My wife and I had dinner at Wilton's on a special occasion. Not a cheap option but outstanding and worth every penny. Attentive service, unhurried (a good thing). Food came out promptly. Cheese souffle and potted shrimp starters followed by lobster omelette, all very good. Quiet alcove table was just what we wanted.
159;Very nice British restaurant with great service and excellent food. Beef Wellington was delicious! A little bit pricey but worth every penny spent
160;Usual top quality food and service they never fail to deliver
161;This traditional, English, restaurant is one of the few places in London where you can guarantee that the food and wine will be excellent, the service impeccable without being intrusive and the ambiance oak panelled luxury with subdued lighting and real comfort.  This doesn't come cheap but you get what you pay for.  Fish, including perfectly grilled Dover sole and wonderful langoustine, vye for top billing along with seasonal grouse.  If there is any complaint it is that the excellent and comprehensive wine list would be improved by the inclusion of more bottles below the £60 level which impacts heavily on the service charge.  It requires no more effort to serve a £250 bottle than a £50.  But at 15% the choice of wine can easily add £30 in service to the bill.
162;Extremely welcoming, friendly and courteous staff who provide a very efficient level of service. Food is excellent.
163;Not the old wilton’s and very expensive.   I think the sole pre cooked?  Service average,  ifthey are ging to take the wine away from table they need to be more attentive onrefils
164;Excellent meal and service from the staff at the restaurant and starting with champagne.
165;Atemporal... Faultless ... Delicious ... Perfect antidote to cold and grey evenings
166;As expected and always delivered, the service, ambiance and particularly the food were all fantastic. A highly recommended spot for seafood and more with a fabulous oyster selection.
167;I love this place, the oysters, the seafood, smoked salmon and on and on.A must each time we visit London.
168;One of the oldest restaurants in London. Great food and excellent service.  The ambiance is traditional and very beautiful. Wine list is great and the food was awesome.
169;Having dinner at Wilton’s is the best thing to do with friends. Everything about this place makes me go back again and again.
170;Always a treat to get back to this exceptional restaurant for amazing seafood, great service and lovely ambiance. The oysters are perfect, the Dover sole is top notch, the savouries are fun and deserts delicious. All that and a wonderful wine list!
171;Overall everything was lovely. My only complaint is the special appetizer of white truffle and scrambled eggs for 60 pounds. Very mediocre and ridiculously expensive. It seems embarrassing for a restaurant such as Wilton’s to offer such a dish. All else was quite pleasant and wonderful after we got beyond the disappointing appetizer.
172;Literally, one of the world's best and most famous restaurants. Expensive, but value for money. Wonderful shellfish and fish, also game. Splendid service.
173;One of the pearls on the London culinary crown !Hospitable, great food, friendly service and a sommelier who knows her wines.
174;Never fails to please!  A great restaurant and long may it remain so!!
175;"Rare and excellent old world atmosphere, good food, interesting wine list.  Formal, attentive service as one would expect from a true Jermyn Street institution.  If you are not one of their regulars, however, do be aware they can push quite hard to turn the table. If you arrive early and/or plan to enjoy a long evening the excessive hovering, stern glances create a feeling of being rushed. More than once we needed to state firmly, ""No I've not quite finished, thank you"" to avoid plates being snatched."
176;A truly excellent English dining experience.
177;A great team, top quality food and overall, a class act
178;In my opinion this must be the best traditional restaurant in town, My wife and I had the most fabulous Dinner on Sat, The food ,The  Staff and Service was all Top Notch, Well Done
179;"Our two visits here were the gastronomic highlights of our nine-day holiday in London.  I came for the grouse, my wife for the fish; everything was excellent: food, service, ambience."
180;Fantastic as always this place always delivers and it’s my favourite restaurant in London __
181;my lobster appetizer was tainted with the smell of a dumpster, as was the main course. the wine poured at my table was reasonable.  I complained when they asked was it good. there was no adjustment in the price, only smug grins as I left the place.  the food and staff were a complete disappointment,
182;This is a perennial favourite! All the British classics are here.
183;You go to Wiltons for unchanging consistency, quiet, consideration for the diner. My plaice was beautiful and a salad starter was excellent.
184;Everything was perfect but the only thing was not good that it was very very hot
185;"This was our first visits; it was so good we returned a few days later."
186;Wonderful food especially the seafood which was outstanding
187;Heard a lot about Wiltons over time --this was our first visit, we were not disappointed! Even made one of the small booths! Food excellent -drinks a little expensive, but for a special occasion not a problem.                                     Be with you again soon Wiltons.
188;Exquisitely Luxuriously Fabulous
189;Fantastic experience on our second visit to Wiltons. Service is impeccable, food delicious (we both had fish and shellfish in my case) and the atmosphere very relaxing yet buzzy. One of my favourite restaurants in London, particularly for lunch.
190;Excellent seafood with the freshest oysters, crustaceans and flatfish. Great wine list and well made cocktails. Traditional and attentive service. Makes dinners an occasion. A bit short on space, the tables for two are a squeeze.
191;Simply Fantastic and as a proper Restuarant should be. No Gimmicks or fussy food just first class cuisine cooked and served superbly. One of my favourite places to eat.
192;Excellent ambiance for a Romantic celebratory meal with superlative service.
193;We have been to Wiltons a number of times usually to celebrate something (bit expensive for us for it to be somewhere we would go a lot).  The food and service have always been outstanding and the ambience is also really nice if you want somewhere not too noisy
194;The ambience is perfect in Wiltons. English, discreet, like a gentleman’s club. Service was friendly but never intrusive. Food was simple in execution, good quality ingredients. Unhesitatingly recommended for a quiet dinner for two.
195;Excellent food and service.  Great ambience and very traditionally English.  Wine list extensive and expensive. Tommaso gave us an exceptional oyster tasting masterclass
196;Wonderful food and service. They even designed a main specially for my wife
197;Extraordinary seafood.  The turbot was magnificent!
198;I took my husband here for his birthday, we loved the traditional food, the building and the people looking after us were charming.
199;A wonderful dining experience , service was impeccable , food was fantastic and the atmosphere is eligant but warm.  Highly recommend this restaurant while in London.
200;I am from Virginia and dinner atWilton’s is always in my agendaWhen in London.
201;Over priced-especially the wine list. Food was terribly basic. Nice if you want quiet romance and very old school surroundings.  But definitely not worth the prices
202;Another lovely birthday meal with outstanding food and friendly professional service.  Dover dole on the bone main course and Pimms jelly pudding were the highlights this time- starting to take the lobster cocktail for granted!
203;Outstanding restaurant , this is better than Michelin star.  Service is second to none and attention to detail is perfection .
204;"Ultra traditional English restaurant on Jermyn Street treasured for many years. Gentlemen's club atmosphere, expert service, English food with excellent regular carving trolley - delightful to have Sunday roast beef on a Wednesday but book early to avoid disappointment. Must also mention my favourite starter, the Cropwell Bishop Stilton twice baked souffle - it usually tempts me away from the set lunch. Wine list is wonderful though few bottles under £50. I have been for lunch about four times and expect to return on future visits to London; I feel really comfortable here."
205;I had a lovely lunch with my husband.  Exceptional service and great food, well cooked and presented. Good ambience, so comfortable I could have stayed all afternoon. Looking forward to dining there again.
206;As always Wilton’s never disappoints. Exceptional food. Lovely staff. This is by far my favourite restaurant.  See you soon.
207;The most elegant and delicious food in London.  Perfect service, old school glamour, excellent quality sustainable food.
208;A sophisticated ‘proper’ restaurant where everything is done with expertise and style. For grown-ups who crave an atmosphere in which you can both hear yourself think and speak, it’s a rare delight.The fish-biased menu is traditional in content and cooking style and uses extremely good ingredients.My partner had lobster cocktail which contained a good half of supremely fresh lobster meat and sensibly allowed for the Marie-rose sauce to be served separately. I had four spamming fresh langoustines which I asked to come in shell but which they will also serve peeled.We both had Dover soles which were sublime. Yes, £60 a piece, but at least 600g each. Perfectly cooked a la meunière they were as good as I ever remember eating.We finished with yet another perfect rendition of crème brûlée and a Pimms jelly.Service was discreet and attentive throughout.With a bottle of Bollinger and a bottle of an interesting Bergerac, we absolutely loved my birthday treat and thoroughly appreciated the complete professionalism of the entire set up.The only reason for 4/5 for value is we did think the mark ups on the wine list were a little extreme even for a Mayfair restaurant!Most importantly, we intend to go back frequently.
209;Delicious seafood and excellent service. Pricey but perfect for a special occasion and the set menu is an excellent deal. Particularly recommend sitting in booths which are very cosy and is a rare restaurant where you can’t hear the next table’s conversation and can hear everyone on your table. Bathroom also very clean and delightfully decorated.
210;Wilton's never fails to impress. Traditional and excellent standards of food and service. Quite one of my favourite restaurants anywhere.
211;Loved it, had Lobster Bisque and prawn cocktail to start, both had Beef Wellington for main, all was great apart from stringy runner beans, staff were great, a lovely place, would visit again
212;Wilton's is the last high class restaurant left in central London.  Good old fashioned luxury and mercifully free of children!
213;The first courses and puddings were wonderful: the main courses were disappointing.  The lamb and sauce lacked flavour and the Risotto  vegetables were undercooked.  The ambience and staff were so friendly and welcoming they ensured that I will be back soon..
214;A certainty beyond age and time, Mayfair and St. James at their best.
215;Wilton's remains true to its traditions. Best Dover sole in London. Impeccable service.
216;A very buttoned up, traditional experience with excellent service and old time-y feel. Unfortunately the food just doesn't live up to the vibe or the price.
217;Our second visit, a very special place.  We opted for fish:  prawn cocktails to start, followed by a lobster (Newburg)  and a sea bream.  We did squeeze in deserts too.... don't know how really. Beautifully presented, tasted as good as it looked. All washed down with a very sensibly priced bottle of house Chablis.  The restaurant was packed but all of the staff are on the ball, nothing is too much trouble.  All runs like a well oiled machine.  Wonderful !!
218;Excellent in every respect. The food, welcome, ambience and service were all impeccable. This Jermyn Street institution maintains timeless standards in the modern age.
219;Stunning food , service , excellent wine flawless  evening
220;Wiltons is always perfect
221;Impeccable service. The food and wine where amazing!
222;Wilton's is a classic.  It hasn't changed in the past 40 years (or maybe longer) and that is such a relief.  It is not trendy but rather old world with everything good that goes with that--superb service, beautiful napery, immaculate and impeccable surroundings, well-polished silver and gleaming glasses.  The food is very good but not great, and that is just as it should be.  I felt like I was back in my grandmother's house.
223;Delicious food and excellent service!
224;Wilton’s is timeless perfection.  The staff are particularly special.
225;Perfect service - Cosy atmosphere - Very Food Quality - Good Wines
226;GREAT I never come to London without stopping at least once in Wilton's!
227;An excellent evening.  The meal was first class and the service attentive but not intrusive. The restaurant is on top form.
228;As ever great food and service, also as ever not an austerity option.
229;Excellent food, very professional and attentive staff.
230;Will come again.  Everything was perfect  and we will have dessert next time too.  They have a great crumble.
231;Faultless service and a lot more relaxed than I had expected.Food was good without being outstanding.Wine list was expensive but I was able to fine something within my budget
232;Our first time and not the last! AMAZING Staff were attentive food was delicious , great ambience. I am from USA and can highly recommend.
233;A wonderful British restaurant. The service is first class and the food is perfectly cooked with excellent choices for both beef and seafood. A distinctly English style and atmosphere. Definitely a favourite
234;The most consistently inspiring restaurant in London.
235;Food is a bit vieux-jeu and overpriced, but classically executed.Service is somewhat sub-par for a restaurant in its class and price range.Ambience is priceless.Toilets should be cleaned more often, we were embarrassed to address the issue directly.
236;Our first visit here and will definitely come back. It is the quality you would expect from this caliber of restaurant. Delicious well presented dishes and a good range of wines etc
237;Excellent dinner in a most reliable place.
238;Both the food and service are great. The attitude of the staff is so special
239;A must visit on every London travel. Great lunch. Semi-business requires a jacket. Very business oriented. Formal setting. Attentive superbe service and food. Dover sole and oysters a must!
240;Just a great dinner!  Went for fish & had leg of pork from the trolley.  Excellent.
241;We have entertained at Wiltons as well as enjoyed quiet meals as a date.  Wilton'smeals regardless of the year claims care.  The bar, the wait-staff, the evolutionof menus through summer and winter makes Wilton's a destination every timewe visit London. The set menu is tremendous value.We go as a date and order wine. The staff has a seasoned pitch for the bestmatch of wine to food.  It been the standard for years and lives up to thevery best in London
242;As always, excellent food and service.
243;Always the best. For me Wilton’s is the best restaurant on the planet.
244;Fabulous,absolutely first class.The cuisine is probably the best we've tasted in London ( or anywhere else for that matter),complemented by discreet yet thoroughly attentive service.The ambience complemented the entire affair.Sumptuous.
245;Superb establishment - always reliable with top class service and food (at a suitable cost).
246;Our very favorite restaurant in London. Dover sole is out of this world and beef is the best. Check the daily carving table and don’t miss dessert!
247;The menu on the evening was nothing like the sample menu on the web site
248;Wonderfully attentive service, delicious food, relaxed and calm atmosphere.  We felt very decadent and entertained.
249;Perfect in every way!
250;Great lunch, lovely cocktails, super service!!
251;We had an excellent experience. The sommelier was superb, knowledgeable and helpful without being pretentious. The food was superb as was the service and ambiance.
252;Excellent greeting, and really helpful in providing a quiet table (that I had forgotten to request) even though they were very busy.  Attentive service, outstanding fish (epic grilled halibut).  very expensive but cossetting and enjoyable
253;Attention to detail first class. Excellent service and wonderful fresh food. Oyster selection probably the best in London. This restaurant has a great reputation for fresh fish and it did not disappoint again on this occasion. I cannot wait to go back again.
254;WE WERE THE FIRST CUSTOMERS ON SATURDAY NIGHT, THE STAFF ARE VERY ATTENTIVE, THE MENU HAD A WIDE CHOICE, DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHAT TO HAVE. THE FISH WAS EXCELLENT, ALSO THE PASSION FRUIT SOUFFLE WAS EXCELLENT.
255;We had the lam and mixed grilled meat with several types of meat. It was good.
256;The main course was disappointing, very greasy with too much butter, service was excellent.
257;The service was great, as was the ambience.  The lunch set menu price was not as advertised online (it was more expensive, which detracted from the Value).  The bill I was presented with at first was wrong, as they'd got the prices and servings wrong i.e. it was for too much.  Why, oh why, do restaurants feel obliged to add a discretionary charge of 12.5% to every bill?  Don't they trust the clientele to add a suitable tip?
258;Love the place for many years and will always come back but the service had to do a little apologizing which shouldn't happen
259;Wonderful dining in London.
260;Excellent meal. We specially appreciated the wine  and the  crumble-apple pie (worth to be served in a  3-michelin star restaurant). We certainly will come  back.
261;Perfect evening to celebrate my husband's birthday
262;Excellent service, a great choice of dishes and beautiful flavours. A lovely experience
263;Excellent as always
264;We spent a delightful evening at Wiltons. We loved the traditional atmosphere and excellent service. It’s comforting to know that this kind of places still exist.
265;So glad we had a meal at Wilton's. The oyster's and the monkfish were highlights from our meal. The service was excellent and I was very happy to very good choices in wines offered by the glass. They also served the best martini we had while in London.
266;It’s wonderful.  Only problem is that the wine is a little expensive.  They should list a few more wines in the £30-£40 region in my opinion.
267;Old fashioned charm, high ratio of customers/staff mean excellent service. Good size tables and low murmur of other diners means a comfortable meal within having to strain to hear companions- for these reasons alone I’d return although food mediocre
268;Loved my lunch at Wilton's.  The service was the best I've received in a long, long time.  Everyone was attentive to every detail of the meal and my service.  I loved the food.  My favorite was the apple crumble and the champagne cocktail.
269;We had a family meal there to celebrate our youngest son's 18th birthday.  It was a real real treat - the kids don't get to places like Wilton's too often!  Very good service and very excellent food in a beautiful dining space.  Maybe we could have done without the maitre d offering my eldest son a jacket because of the 'no T-shirts' rule, but tbh it kind of added to the occasion! A special evening.
270;Old School Classic setting. Amazing Seafood and great wines.
271;Wonderful food, attentive service
272;The waiting staff are exemplary. The food was delicious. The ambience is perfect for this type of establishment. It is “old school “ British fine dining at its best. I will definitely be back
273;We enjoyed the booth. The food and service was excellent in every way.
274;Wilton's is quite simply an exceptionally good restaurant.
275;Very traditional.   Food 8 of 10. Would have been better if all entree’s were hot. Waitstaff very professional but of course trying to upsell. Definitely go for a very good classic British dining experience.
276;superb.   beautiful fresh langoustines followed by Dover Sole and a great house Chablis.  Pure delight!
277;Very enjoyable evening, spot on service. Excellent food. Quite expensive but that wasn't a surprise. I would rate it outstanding.
278;Very good, very traditional British dining,,,,and the Sole, Beef Wellington are great!
279;This is one of the finest restaurants in the world. Consistently exceeds expectations in food quality, service, charm and professionalism. It has its own culture which makes it even more special.
280;My wife and I had a fabulous meal at Wiltons, the service, food and friendliness of the staff was faultless. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and after the main course  the waiter brought out some chocolate truffles on a plate decorated with Happy Birthday in chocolate,  it was a lovely touch. We have already recommended  this restaurant to family and we will be returning ourselves when we are next in London.
281;Everything was superb. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. This is a classy British restaurant and as such is not cheap.
282;The food was excellent.  This can only be achieved by top quality ingredients, particularly the meat.  Cooked to perfection and complemented by excellent service.  A thoroughly enjoyable experience, again.
283;The meal was superb, the atmosphere relaxing and the staff are very professional, courteous and helpful.Overall a great meal, and will definitely go again.  Just a bit painful on the pocket....
284;First class restaurant.  Marvellous dining experience.  Food and service exceptional.  Wine a bit on the expensive side but this is only a minor quibble and should stop you from visiting this wonderful establishment.
285;The best of all our dining experiences at W iltons. Seated in the private dining room. Very quiet.
286;This is a very stylish restaurant with attentive staff - but they are discrete at the same time.  Top quality cuisine and I'll definitely return.
287;Lovely restaurant,  superb food and delightful, efficient staff.
288;Outstanding service and food. I've thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience here. Their seafood is amazing and the lobster omelette is absolutely worth trying.
289;Wiltons added good memory on our trip for London. Nice oyster and salmon and Dover sole.
290;I have dined at Wiltons whenever I'm in London for the last twenty-five years and it never fails to be please. Its the perfect place for an outstanding meal and service all provided in the most agreeable manner.
291;Really enjoyed our Saturday night visit to Wilton's. So interesting to read the history of the establishment and  we very much appreciated all the quality branding on glasses , napkins and even the carpet. If we go again I will book a booth as our table was very close to the service door so constant foot traffic of staff and door opening. The food was delicious and the inexpensive french wine we chose from the wine list was delicious
292;We had a wonderful evening. The ambiance and the food we're very good. The level of service from the staff was fantastic. We'll be back.
293;Always fantastic food, wine and service. We love it.
294;As ever Wiltons is the last word in luxury, service and quality. This visit was to celebrate my wife’s birthday and everything from the minute we entered to the minute we left was perfect. Our favourite London restaurant.
295;Quintessential English restaurant with impeccable greeting followed by  food of finest quality.
296;There is nowhere quite like Wilton's. If you were being really unkind, you'd say (if you were of a certain age) that it's reminiscent of a very superior Trust House Forte dining room, but in the very heart of Clubland. If you're not over-fussed about the money (NB), it's still a great and comforting bolthole, offering good (and sometimes very good) English classics, if at prices at which you might perhaps expect rather more. The service is exceptional.
297;Overall an enjoyable experience. However, this restaurant has to join my growing list of venues which exploit their reputation to charge prices way beyond what could be considered value for money.
298;For our first visit, recommended by a Google search for Fish Restaurants in the area, it was superb in all aspects. Ambiance, food quality, service and friendliness of staff waiting on tables. Knowledgeable staff to. It is not cheap by any means. It is also the oldest fish restaurant in London and we will most certainly be returning. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.
299;Absolutely wonderful. As we remembered. Stayed too late = thoroughly enjoyed it!!
300;It was a faultless evening.  Thank you very much. Food and service perfect.
301;Well, as it is the beast restaurant in London it was, not surprisingly, quite delicious with immaculate service.
302;Very nice traditional place where we enjoyed different types of food. From fish to meat. The Dover sole is incredibile, the same for the wild oysters.
303;not as good as past experiencesslow service and brusquesome food excellent other mediocre error in coats retrieval
304;As always top class meal and service.
305;An amazing restaurant!! Everything is superb, especially it was so quite! Wait staff was kind and attentive, and most of all, the food was amazing! Definitely want to go back!
306;Have been going to this restaurant for many years - its perfect for a special occasion! The lobster is the best and service impeccable.
307;A wonderful treat. Excellent service and first class ingredients perfectly cooked.
308;Lovely. Really civilised spot for a quiet lunch. My daughter Flora Roberts had recently done a frieze/mural in the private dining room and the kind manager took me in to see it and photo it. A great place for a party (if you can afford it!)
309;If you want the best ingredients cooked to perfection in the most comfortable surroundings and wish to be looked after by a team of friendly kind attentive people, look no further. If you want pseudo-sophistication with food made over complicated and endless bowing and scraping - go elsewhere. This is the ultimate for those able to appreciate it
310;Perfect in every way. My husband and I booked for dinner as we have been meaning to dine here for some time. The overall experience definitely met our expectations. We arrived a little late, which didn't seem to be a problem. We were  seated at a quiet table as previously requested. Lovely food and ambience, comfortable surroundings, service impeccable - professional and attentive without feeling intrusive. We will definitely be returning.
311;I do have some hesitations with regards to going back to Wiltons. I had high expectation from it, but the service was a big let down. I was definitely put off by the fact that they offered langoustines to every other table except for us. It could be that we were Oriental. We definitely felt that there was discrimination on the part of the staff. We just cannot accept this kind of treatment, as we are also paying the same price as the other customers dining in the restaurant. I just hope this is just a one-off occurrence.
312;An excellent evening, quiet, professional service and just outstandingly good food. Yes this is a consummate fish restaurant but three of us had absolutely brilliant filet steaks, so a wide diversity of choice.  And importantly the vegetables were perfect too. As close to faultless as it gets.
313;Very over priced. Waiting staff very intrusive and seem to stand over you all the time.   No check backs to table. We were never asked if our food was ok. The only friendly staff member was the gentleman who brought my coffee at end of meal. its a pity as this could be a nice experience as the furnishings are very nice.
314;We were on vacation for a week crossing the Atlantic on the Queen Mary 2 and in London. Wilton's was the very best place we ate, though everyplace was good. At Wilton's we had the best Dover Sole imaginable and the sight of the Beef Wellington on the trolley induced rampant salivation. Great service and beautiful place. Can't wait to get there again
315;Close friends Christmas meal.
316;Quality produce cooked to perfection. Traditional, friendly and relaxing.
317;Great fish and suitable wines to accompanyExcellent service
318;Impeccable service, beautifully presented and cooked dishes, no music, best for fish and meat.
319;This place is THE BOMB!!!  if you are in London and don't eat here then you are missing an amazing dining experience. Location, atmosphere, service, food... it's all here.
320;First class traditional dining
321;Food/service fine but a little surprised at the £44 cost of 2 glasses of (house) champagne: and had to remind our waiter that we wanted to drink the rest our red wine (about half a bottle) - he had thought we had finished it!
322;Wilton's combines superbly-prepared food with an elegant ambiance.  Its expert staff maintain this high standard with a welcoming, unstuffy atmosphere.  Wilton's is high dining at its best.
323;Disappointing time not as good as it was 2 years ago. Food came too quickly was good but both that and the wine were ovepriced.
324;This is a stunning restaurant that screams proper Victorian glamour (or Edwardian, I know nothing of these things). The food is expensive but good. I had the lobster cocktail as a starter which was really good and the halibut as a main which was perfectly cooked to be expected. My problem with this place was that I had dinner at 6pm as a pré theatre meal. I phoned before booking to check they had a pré theatre menu and on the website they said they had - however due to me arriving late due to circumstances out of my control I phoned my dinner companion to order for me and the waiter claimed that this was not the case. As a result à dinner that we had would have been great if we had 1h30min minimum to savour it but by the time we arrived we had 45min. I would have chosen another venue if there was no pré theatre menue as it was a very expensive meal and I don't know who was correct.
325;I love Wilton’s the food is fabulous, the service perfect and the interior spacious but cosy.
326;Just perfect!
327;Wiltons is something of an institution.  It's expensive, but given the location and the quality of the food and the service, it's also a bargain.  If they don't have Michelin stars, it's because they're not interested in that type of cuisine.  Instead Wiltons serves the sort of food people normally want to eat, whether it's oysters and caviar or an indulgent and very British mixed grill.  I had an excellent sole meuniere.Wiltons is staffed with a generous number of keen waiters and service is top notch.
328;"Wilton's is not cheap, but delivers what you need; fine food, fine wine, relaxed atmosphere, good service, no music."
329;A wonderful treat from start to finish. The service and the food were exceptional. This may seem a little too traditional for the hip and chic, but if you love the best food available then go to Wilton’s. The smoked salmon was sublime.  If you like white fish then I would recommend the very tasty grilled halibut, simple but cooked to perfection. Superb selection of wines by the glass to compliment the menu. This is quickly becoming one of our favourite places to dine in London.
330;Really impressed with our dinner at Wiltons who had read my special request for a booth setting which was gratefully received! Very attentive welcome to the restaurant and cocktails were promptly provided at the bar area.  Food wise, the cheese soufflé was fantastic, only bettered by the delicious venison and whilst not normally a highlight for any meal, the creamed potato (aka mash!) was the best I've ever had! My wife had the mushroom soup followed by the beef fillet (cooked to perfection) which she said were both amazing.The fact they remembered it was my wife's birthday (a birthday plate of chocolate truffles was a nice touch) and the overall experience from start to finish we had, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to all my friends (of which I already have!).
331;I took my partner here for his birthday , we had been to Marcus Waring Gilbert Scott restaurant the night before , Wilton is way above that in the quality of the food, bearing in mind they were about the same priceWilton is a great place to eat the ambience is beautiful, the food delicious and the service exceptional Will definitely be making further reservations
332;I have not been to Wilton's for over 20 years. I guess living in Australia gives the reason. It was my fathers favourite restaurant when he worked in London 21 years ago, and I always enjoyed eating there. This time I went with my husband and one of my sons who was also in London. I wanted to share the experience with him, and I was NOT disappointed. Wilton's still offers the most amazing service and all the food favourites that I remembered with a few new ones too. We all had a wonderful time and eating at Wilton's will continue to be a must do on any visit to London.
333;We were looked after very well and we had a baby with us and were given a lovely spacious table. Good job guys
334;Always wonderful to be back at Wilton’s   A second dining home when I am there
335;Marvelous old school place.  Highly recommendedfor the beautiful silver service alone.
336;It is a very unassuming restaurant with wonderful staff. The food is uncomplicated and very tasty. We had oysters and langoustines for a starter, both fresh and meaty. After a bit of deliberation we decided to go for roast leg of lamb, which was divine and equally as good pheasant. We did find a space for deserts putting a stamp of approval to the whole experience. It is not cheap, but if you want to eat well in a cosy environment and friendly staff, it is worth every penny.
337;Outstanding wine list. The closest to dining in a fine London Club, without all that entails.
338;Altogether very affable and relaxed!Lovely room and table layout.Good linen, silver and glassware.Excellent service, formal but friendly.Broad-scope menu and eclectic wine list.
339;Excellent place with plenty of history and character. Really great food and service. Worth the effort of getting dressed up a little!
340;Made special request for nice table but table was small and cramped.Ordered an aperitif and a bottle of wine. Wine waiter said he would wait until we had finished our champagne before serving the wine. We said OK but then wine waiter forgot about us. We had our starter. No bread rolls offered with soup. Time passed. Chased a waiter. Could we have a glass of wine. Waiter started bringing us the wine list, not aware we had already ordered a bottle. Pointed out our bottle. Waiter brought bottle to our table and poured our wine without offering chance to taste.Partridge and gin-soaked plum v good. Lobster Newburg OK.
341;If you are in the UK, are in London, and want a modern Downtown Abbey-like British meal experience, look no further! Wiltons is an institution. While British food may not have some of the fanciness of French and Italian cuisines, British food like that at Wiltons centers on high quality meat such as fish, beef, lamb, and game, as well as classic potato and vegetable accompaniments, and all the correct sauces. Don't try to eat lamb without the mint jelly!Being a high end restaurant, there will be no difficulty in ordering perfect cocktails, champagne, and wine from the extensive list. And excellent service. Being the institution that Wiltons is, located in the heart of St. James, you will no doubt be sitting with His Grace the Duke of somewhere-or-other on one side, a well known actor on the other, and His Excellency the US Ambassador with the UK Business Secretary and their bodyguards just beyond!A must-go!
342;Outstanding food and service.  Exceptional preparations of Dover Sole.
343;Wilton’s is a trusted destination that never disappoints. The professionalism of service, while occasionally overbearing, is appreciated and the dishes are superb. When in London it is always a priority.
344;Wilton’s is a restaurant legend and it’s a MUST for London visitors who like good authentic food and amazing original atmosphere!Since 275 years Wilton’s is celebrating tradition,style and classic food on a high level!Oysters,caviar,crabs etc - Wilton’s is THE place for Seafood lovers and enthusiasts of traditional professional gastronomic experience!
345;It is always a treat to go to Wiltons. It is one of our very favourite restaurants when we come to London.
346;Paragon of excellence
347;Excellent service. Great oysters and wines. The mains were mediocre. It's a beautiful place with great history. Be mindful dress code is conservative no trainers or funky heels suit jackets and conservative dresses recommended if you don't like being looked at with curiosity
348;Simply the perfect restaurant
349;Best British Classic you will find.Defines what it means to be perfect
350;Better than ever __ Perfect combination of classics and seasonal,  great wine advice. Beautiful oysters (of  course) and great plaice!
351;Excellent service, food, and drink.  Lovely surroundings in a classic restaurant.  Great fish and game selection.
352;The atmosphere here is nice for a cosy, somewhat luxurious fall or winter evening. Service is great. Food is very average, at best,based on what i ate anyway. I wouldn't go back unless looking for atmosphere over food.
353;As ever fine food, excellent wines served efficiently and politely. Pretty much as you would expect
354;Food is OK.  The Dover sole could be better if had not been lightly burned on the skin to avoid bitterness.
355;Always a pleasure to return to Wiltons.  I am shocked when I (a frequent visitor from the States) host a London guest for the first time at this classic establishment.  Surely not to be missed.
356;Wiltons has really becomes my favourite through the years. I return again and again and I am all time surprised by the Hugh quality.
357;Delicious meal and attentive, considerate service . Thank you
358;The food was very good quality, the atmosphere pleasant and relaxed, the service attentive and friendly. We spent a nice evening and will come back
359;Outstanding food, impeccable service and incomparable staff!!!!
360;My first visit and it was delightful.The staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming.The food was delicious.A wonderful evening.Thank you.Michael Clarke
361;Wilton's is a superb English seafood restaurant, one of the very best. The food, wine list and service are all five star. I have been going to Wilton's for 55 years.
362;Wilton’s has always been an old standby for us.  Reliably good food, friendly and it doesn’t seem like they are just trying to turn your table as quickly as possible.  My only complaint this time was they had three two tops in a row all vacant.  They placed us in the middle one which was smack dab under a spotlight.  It was increasingly uncomfortable as the evening went on.  I asked the waiter if he could dim it which he said was impossible.  He said we could move to one of the other tables.  At this point we didn’t particularly want to move when we already had food on the table.  Later Another manager/waiter must have seen me squinting because he asked me if everything was okay...I mentioned the spotlight and he agreed but also said they couldn’t turn it down.  He suggested the next time to ask to sit in another room.   They were all very nice about it but something definitely needs to be done about their “mood lighting”:  it would be far superior to feel comfortable and relaxed while dining rather than being under an interrogation light.  Yes, it was that bad.
363;I took my husband to Wiltons for his birthday. Bearing in mind we are in our thirties I would say that most people dining there were 30-40 years older than us, so it is a little quiet but that is definitely a perk! The service was impeccable, the food delicious and we loved the old-world charm it has. Some of it (i.e the loos) could do with a spruce but if you love seafood you have to eat here at least once!
364;Es un clásico exquisito para los amantes del buen gusto q no se pueden perder!!!
365;A classic .... The best restaurant to define England's finest culinary tradition: seafood and game....especially oysters. Phillipo is a master at selecting and preparing the finest oysters from the United Kingdom.
366;My Wife And I  had a most enjoyable evening excellent food, Very pleasant staff  10/10
367;I have been going to Wiltons for more years than I care to remember.  That is in itself to the fact that it is a great place and the food and service cannot be bettered anywhere
368;Have dined at this restaurant before, and was pleased.  Last experience, however, was different.  Dinner was served too fast and the Captain literally threw the food on the table and did not return.  There was a mistake, but no one checked on us. Food was very good, as usual, but, because of bad service, the experience was disappointing.  Not likely to return anytime soon.
369;Fantastic food and ambience as usual. I'm always taken aback by the incredible service and attention to detail. A  great place to dress up a bit, and enjoy an evening of Old World luxury.
370;We love Wilton's and it continues to be a favourite. One small cricism some starters a little pricey .
371;While in London - from Switzerland,  I always enjoy local, food and drinks.
372;A quiet restaurant with good service and good food.
373;Excellent food served in a very English atmosphere.  Wilton's has been excellent for generations and lives up to its reputation and every expectation.
374;Always a great place, excellent service, knowledgable sommelier, beautiful food. In great surroundings.
375;Air con in restaurant leaking
376;"This is what a lazy weekday lunch should be like. Half a dozen perfect Jersey oysters; great roast sirloin, Yorkshire pudding and roast potatoes; and a modern take on an Eton mess; all washed down with champagne. A fine way to escape the world for a couple of hours."
377;Always a pleasure! They serve the best oysters you can wish for and cuisine quality is always up to the best standard. Service is discreet but at the same time nice and accomodating. Highly recomended.
378;Food was good, especially the strawberry souffle at the end.
379;As always, the food was excellent and the service was both professional and very friendly
380;Love dining here - it's like going back in time. The staff are brilliant and not snooty at all, given it's such an 'establishment' type of place.
381;It was like eating in a men's club. Proper formal service. Excellent food, the Dover sole was the best in London. Berry pudding for dessert was just right not to sweet. I'll be back
382;"A classic... and better with age!! Most recent visit was most impressive.  Very friendly staff despite the hush-hush gentlemen club decor; excellent fresh oysters even in Summer, dresses crab was indeed ""dressy"" and refreshing; grouse season has just begun and the bird was coooked to perfection - best time to have the dish if one not wish to be overwhelmed by pungent gamey taste.A must try London gem, a must return also!!"
383;We invited London friends we met on a cruise who had recommended the restaurant. We were greeted with a glass of great champagne, and viewed an open cart rack of pork that looked beautiful. Three of us ordered it. For the $55 price we received four very thin, small slices of pork that was overcooked, dry, and lying in a bed of sauce. I ate one piece (as did one other guest) plus one piece of roasted potato, which was great. No one ate all their pork.The desert was an absolutely wonderful apple crumble ... about the best I've ever had. The lunch for four came in at over $350, including a service charge. Two in the party had one glass of house wine each. Although the restaurant dates from about 1740, it was about the worst value for the money on our 3-week multi-city vacation.Would consider going back for a second try. Maybe the pork was just a bad choice ... but it looked too good to pass up.
384;I was looking forward to experiencing this establishment during our trip. I bit disappointing. The stage was set by a rude waiter and didn't improve a lot. The food was at best average b
385;The food and service were both exceptional...a birthday lunch to remember. We won't wait another ten years before we return!
386;Perfect service and wonderful cuisine. Will definitely return
387;Old school restaurant. Nice english type restaurant. Service very good. Wine list good. Over priced oysters. We had Salmon. Nothing special. You guys decide.
388;Perfection in every respect. Felt like an escape from the real world into a world of sheer pleasure. The staff are incredible. Food sublime and wine is delicious. Loved every minute. Thank you!
389;Our first visit to Wiltons and we were not disappointed. This is certainly a superb venue if you love fish. Tremendous food, atmosphere and excellent service.We will certainly be back when the bank balance has recovered! Expensive but worth it.
390;Food perfection however the service very attentive, at times bordering on too much so. The best apple crumble in London.
391;We loved Wiltons from the moment we walked in. It has that very warm and welcoming feeling when you walk in which comes from both the décor and table settings through to the staff. The choice of food was excellent and it all tasted delicious. A firm favourite!
392;Elegant seafood-centric British icon. An essential London experience.
393;We went for a special occasion and it was! Most memorable and we look forward to going back. The staff made us very welcome and feel as if they were only there for us.
394;All really good
395;It was very special, great food, wonderful service and a lovely atmosphere
396;The food was stunning, wild smoked salmon, native lobster newburg and summer pudding. Drinks also fantastic,  Puligny-Montrachet buy the glass via Coravin was sensational with the lobster.But it was the unobtrusive, attentive service that is truly second to none as always.
397;Treated wonderfully. Best oysters in London. Really truly recommend.
398;I have been a customer of Wiltons for over 40 years, whats happened ? Since Patrick and Sammy have left or died the place is awful. Potted shrimps uneatable and served on wet toast, dover sole thought and dry.. Its just so sad to see a landmark in steep decline. I feel that Hambro may have sold or has certainly taken his eye off the place. Even the pictures of the Royal family have been removed I will now join them.
399;We had a good table with plenty of room. The service was impeccable. The fish dishes are justifiably famous in Wilton's. We both had lobster bisque, which was delicious. Then, as a treat, lobster Thermidor.
400;A traditional visit, always a delight. Enjoy top ingredients un the respect of century old tradition.
401;Always a great experience,we thoughly enjoyed it.my only disappointment I came 10,000 miles for a Dover Sole and the waiter talked me out of it. We were chuffed that our table was the one featured on one of your post cards.____
402;Wiltons, the second oldest restaurant in London (after Rules), is sheer perfection. A happy place to eat perfectly cooked food of the highest quality . I love every thing about it
403;Great food, great service
404;We had an early evening booking, and were seated at a quiet side table which was perfect. My oysters were excellent, the scallops over-cooked and over-priced. My fish was superb, the mixed grill was dry and over-cooked. The 'fried' potatoes were chips, why not say chips on the menu??I hadn't complained about the scallops, but I did about the mixed grill and chips. Surely they can cook saute potatoes? The service was very good without being intrusive. The manager was apologetic and asked if I'd like to go back to discuss our meal. I politely declined, and suggested that maybe they rely on their name regarding the food as 3 out of 6 dishes weren't good. Very disappointed indeed.
405;Everything was superb !! Food, ambiance, service... a very nice evening
406;a very good fish restaurant in central London, a great classic with a friendly staff.
407;Every bit as good as I expected (and as I remembered from many years ago) The service is truly exceptional and the food, promptly cooked and served, delicious . Although not cheap, over £100 per person, it is great value as it is a unique dining experience.
408;Always one of our favorite places in London!The food and service was excellent
409;truly excellent old school restaurant with great service, wonderful food, not least the sea food options and the very extensive wine list, The Wiltons own white wine brand in fact provides very good quality to the price
410;Wiltons more and more tends to be my favourite in London due to high British quality of the food and drinks, excellent service and a warm ambiance.
411;For the highest quality fresh British ingredients, simply cooked to bring out the natural flavour, Wiltons is the place to go in London. Wonderful for fresh and smoked fish and for game.
412;The food as always was just perfect.  Service incredible and really enjoyable.  The bill was also incredible but that is to be expected.  We shall be back.
413;Awesome food, and the  sommelier knowledge and interaction with us made the night even more special. Great wine list.
414;Very possibly the best meal we have ever tasted! Not only was the food incredible but the service outstanding. Bravo!
415;A special occasion. My friend's first trip to London. Had to take him to the famous Wilton's which did not disappoint.
416;Fiancées birthday for which I asked special table. Which we got. Didn't ask, but got mini dessert with Happy Birthday written on it. Impeccable service and amazing food.
417;First rate in every detail. Elegant ambiance. Superb traditional English fare. More value than whatever  the final tote.
418;Fabulous as always - not only great food but the best staff in London
419;Excellent food just need more of it. The head waiter did offer us some smoked salmon to help fill the gap which was a lovely and kind gesture. However value for money I wouldn't recommend it as the portions are considerably smaller than I thought and for considerably more money. Having been several other top 10 seafood restaurants in London, this one was a little bit of a let down.
420;To be fair, the food is very high quality and it's a good place for a high-quality social meal. They have many wines, but they are quite expensive and I did not find the recommended wine really brought out the food the way I would have hoped. I find it difficult to find anything that recommends Wiltons over any similar establishment, be it Bellamy's, the Guinea Grill, or what have you. It's really quite decent, but doesn't rise to a level that I would consider it essential London dining.
421;This was our second time at Wiltons for dinner after the theatre, and it was excellent, as was the first time last year.  We will make Wiltons one of our favourite London restaurants.L
422;Platonic ideal among restaurants. Recommend smoked salmon, then Dover sole meunière off the bone with creamed spinach and jersey royals, along with impeccable service.
423;My husband and I reserved a table at Wilton's to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary.  On our arrival we gave our names and there was no booking to be found.  Fortunately there was space available and they were very gracious and gave us a lovely table.  Unlike another restaurant that seated us next to the kitchen the previous evening.  The wine list was superb.  The ambiance was formal British elegance.  The service was very attentive and you were treated with great respect.  The seating was very comfortable and one did not get the feeling that  you were crammed into a space in order to fit as many people as possible.  Quintessentially British!
424;Excellent service, with very traditional well prepared food. The wine list was not extensive but very well chosen.Definitely will be a regular visit on future London trips. I have no hesitation in recommending this fine establishment.
425;Totally reliable largely traditional food, friendly service, unchanging ambiance. May be the same in another 275 years.
426;Took my other half here for birthday.  Staff were lovely, has a great old English, homely feel - even came along with a mini dessert at the end with Happy Birthday.  We ordered lobster bisque, crabmeat , monkfish and Dover sole along with a few sides which filled us to the brim and was really tasty.Only strange thing we noticed is that everyone else was shown the special of the day, but we weren't - not sure why.  We only noticed after we already had our meals so didn't do anything about it.
427;Wiltons continues to live up to expectations. Good food and service. Comfortable and relaxed. A lovely evening.
428;We have visited this restaurant on a number of occasions when we have been in London.  I'm pleased to say it never disappoints Fantastic service, fantastic food in a fantastic location.You can see why this Resturant is one of the oldest restaurants in LondonWell worth the visit
429;Wilton's never disappoints. A first class dinner with the best Dover sole in the world. Expensive, yes but worth every penny.
430;Absolutely fantastic, from the moment we walked through the door to the moment we left. Service absolutely second to none, food totally delicious, incredible (but expensive) wine list. A perfect evening, I could not recommend Wiltons highly enough!
431;Cute, cozy place. Amazing food! Wish the crowd was more trendy, otherwise if would be perfect!
432;100 per cent perfect. What a dover sole. We loved our table. We will be back. For sure. WOW!!!
433;Great seafood and good service. The ambience was calm and enjoyable without being dull. Allergy was well accommodated. Generally exemplary service was let down a couple of times later in the evening with very slow coffee and tea service and missed second digestif. The seafood was delicious and fresh as were the vegetables. Quite expensive but not surprising given the location
434;My wife and I had a wonderful experience at Wiltons for a birthday dinner.  Lovely, elegant surroundings.  Exquisite traditional British food and the service was professional and attentive without being overbearing.  It's not cheap - budget at least £100 per person if you're going a la carte.  Highly recommended for a special occasion.
435;Quintessentially High-end London.  Great fish and grills.  Staff is efficient but a bit abrupt at times.  The room is somewhat cramped but very atmospheric.  Crowd is a good mix of tourists and locals.  Definitely worth a trip.
436;Beef Wellington was outstanding
437;Fabulous service and excellent food in an old world historic dining venue.
438;Good as usual
439;Fabulous as always. Love the traditional fare, reliability and elegance.
440;Probably about my 25th visit to Wiltons. The trouble is that I expect everything to be perfect in this particular restaurant. We arrived at 1.30 and it was a very busy lunchtime . We were immediately served water, but then we were left for what seemed like ages and eventually I had to ask a waiter to bring some menus. We both chose Lobster Bisque which was terrific. But we still had not been offered any bread, so I had to request that. With the main course we decided to share 3 plates of side orders, they duly arrived but without any spoons to serve them and therefore not wishing to usher a waiter over for a third time we used our forks which was rather tricky with creamed potato. After the sweet, we needed to pay up and leave but all the waiters had disappeared, so I had to leave the table to ask for the bill. I paid the service charge in full but feel that for once I should not have done so. The quality of food was excellent as usual. Wiltons remains one of my absolute favourites, but socks may need pulling up on the service front.
441;Excellent food and service as usual in wonderful surroundings
442;As, always top-food and top-service !Marc - Belgium
443;It was perfect...historic restaurant in St James's I'd always wanted to try. So glad I was able to finally go. Ambience, food, service all superb. Open for 175 years...I can see why!
444;Wow, fabulous experience, great service, ambience.....not a surprise that Wiltons has been in continuous operation since 1742. £200 for 2, so special occasions only (for me at least), but a British classic.
445;Exceptional. Great seafood and a wonderful relaxed ambience.
446;Our favourite London restaurant!
447;"My favourite restaurant in London, especially for fish of all kinds.  Hearkens back to my early days when a good restaurant took care of you from the moment you walked in to the moment you got into your cab and left.  The food is superb, the drinks are great.  The ambience is what you'd expect for an old restaurant on Jermyn St.  I was going to say ""it's pricey"" but it transcends that into downright expensive but if you like fine dining or want to treat someone special to the quintessential fine dining experience, this will certainly serve.  I highly recommend it."
448;Wiltons has become my favourite in London. It is British with highest quality. When in London I very much like to eat British food of best quality. Wiltons provides that.
449;Absolute gem. Impeccable service. Old world British experience. Quiet romantic atmosphere where people still dress up and no one os in their cell phones - a place out of time
450;Had table booked for a birthday,food was unbelievably good highly recommend.
451;Service excellent as always but £38 for a glass of wine was a pity!
452;Our long-time favourite venue for its top quality food, service and ambiance. None better.
453;Great food, helpful staff, very expensive but worth going back again
454;A First Class Dining experience, quality food with quality service.
455;Excellent service, delicious meals. Staff very pleasant, overall exquisite experience.
456;Wonderfully elegant atmosphere and superb delicious food. Great wine and the best champagne in town
457;Words can not describe the fabulous dining experience last night at Wiltons. From start to finish everything from the food, staff, ambiance was memorable. I wanted to choose a restaurant that was fitting for my friend from the USA I had not seen for 25 years. Wiltons did not disappoint - it exceeded everyones expectations. My friend manages 7 hotels in the USA said it was the best dining experience she had for many a year.My friend and I had the tasting menu - starters sea trout - simply presented and tasted amazing.  She had the steak and kidney pudding which oozed a decadent and rich sauce as her fork glided through the pudding. I had fish which was perfect and her fiance had a omelette which he requested if he could have it made with egg yolk - our waiter checked with the chef and this was not a problem.Dessert creme brûlée with poached pears which was heaven on a plate. My friend had apple crumble which was outstanding. Petit fours - melt in your mouth gems of loveliness. Those little special touches from the staff made our dinning experience memorable.  Thank you so much - Anne, Carmen and Ron x
458;We were a 1.30 table and got a poor table as a result. In the gangway between bar area and restaurant, by the carvery station. Apart from that food and service was impeccable as usual.
459;this restaurant keeps the same top class food and service, simply the best
460;This restaurant is a rarity. The exquisite food and the attentive, pleasant staff are superb. While certainly elegant,  Wiltons is also comfortable and warm.  The night was the highlight of our stay in London. Be smart, make this restaurant the centerpiece of your dining.
461;The ambience, attention to detail and quality of the food were excellent - fresh  ingredients very well prepared.
462;I thought I would surprise my husband with a meal at Wiltons as we had never been there before but I had heard from a colleague the good was very good. I must say from the moment we arrived the service was second to none and the staff could not do enough for you. The quality of food was sublime and the wine list extensive. The only thing for me that was s little disappointing was there was no white port to enjoy with the cheeseboard. Would we return - most definitely!
463;Probably the best Dover Sole I have ever had - great food and service. Could benefit from a little background music
464;It's Wiltons. It's pretty much the best restaurant in London. Everything oozes class and comfort. OK it's crazy expensive - but other places are charging similar for sterile tasting menus that leave you hungry at the end of the night. They also let you have your table for the evening - and are in no hurry to push you out the door. Best saved for special occasions. Unless you win the lottery. Repeatedly.
465;Excellent service. Homely surroundings. Good food. Wine list could have been more varied. Too much French
466;If you want an impeccable meal in the heart of St 'James with lots of traditional dishes good wine and impeccable service you should visit Wilton's and you will  not be disappointed
467;We had a delightful evening for my husbands birthday and would highly recommend Wiltons
468;A meal at Wilton's never fails - always a really special event and wonderful food in a special place with superb and obliging staff.  And this did not disappoint - nothing negative to say, except the wine waiter could be a bit more user-friendly.
469;Lovely meal
470;Excellent food, great service and a lovely  ambience.
471;Lovely setting in the heart of the West End. You can feel the history of the place. We had the 3 courses for £38 option and was excellent.
472;I took a client and the overall experience was excellent. The mixed grill was beautiful and there was sufficient choice for everyone depending on their tastes. The wine list was reasonable at all levels
473;Very good food and wine served with great style, ambiance is excellent in an old fashioned proper way which is fun. Well worth a vistit to see how it should be done.
474;Fantastic place with a classic seafood menu executed to perfection and faultless service - go for a special occasion and treat yourself to the lobster!
475;Suitable for old fashion- lover.  Food was average.
476;very very delicious!!  In addition, I want to go!!
477;Wonderful.  I took my Mum for her Birthday and she loved it. The waitress in particular was excellent.
478;Great restaurant, you won't ever regret dining at Wiltons, probably one of the top 2 or 3 traditional restaurants in London. Great for fish and sea food!
479;Food and drink were very good, while service was not rushed. The only issue I had was a rather noisy neighboring table and being near a heavy traffic flow of waiters/waitresses  which was a little distracting. Menu was interesting enough to warrant another visit.
480;Great food in a historic Restaurant. Oysters were superb and great service
481;perfect in all, a special attention for a birthday from the service team, it was very kind
482;Had a romantic dinner with my husband. Restaurant has lots of history and is very comfortable. Food was excellent - especially the Dover sole. Great service. Would definitely return
483;We enjoyed a relaxed lunch, service was prompt, friendly and not overpowering or pressured. The roast beef with accompaniments was delicious. The sommelier's recommendation was spot on and good value. I would definitely return for another wonderful lunch.
484;As ever at Wilton’s, a good meal professionally presented!
485;This place came highly recommended from a well travelled friend and it did not disappoint. The staff and service are unparallelled.  The wines are superb. Loved this traditional place. Will return.  Value for money = Wiltons
486;A staple of any London trip, Wilton's never disappoints. Amazing food, and even more amazing staff.
487;"Wiltons is a restaurant I visit for fish; it is the ability to eat fish in gracious and pleasant surroundings that pay respect to past decor rather than trying to be ultra chic that I like.  It is a comfortable and familiar place to visit.  I do have comments to make, however, about what was on offer when I visited.  Firstly, there was no turbot on the menu.  I know that this is a fish often on Wilton's menu; it's the king of Atlantic fish and sea bass is merely the Prince !  I was quite okay with it not being available when I visited but it would have been nice to know if it was back on the menu the following week.  Being told 'no' left me with no hope but to go and find somewhere else with turbot on the menu for a future booking !The wine menu is particularly French.  There are some other wines but there is not a good selection of Italian wines.  There are so many fine Italian wines, but somehow the wine list is French dominated.  It would be pleasant if the restaurant was less Francophile and more Italophile (or even Hispanophile !) - a more varied choice on the wine list.The price per glass for wine is expensive (Macon - £14 per glass) and the charge per portion of food is high.  It would be a great boon to the diner if, perhaps, the portions were a little bigger or the wine glass just a tad fuller to offer value for the money charged.Overall it is a pleasant restaurant with attentive staff and the food is well presented and of good quality."
488;Outstanding service, great atmosphere and good food. A great place to dress up (wear a tie for example) and enjoy a fine evening.
489;This was the third time we have been dining in this good restaurant! The food has been great, but everytime they have only had one lobster left..our main waiter was very ruud so we told the  head waiter. He did his best to please us with free drinks:) we had a good evening thanks to him:) i think we will come back!
490;Wiltons is a classic,always reliable,with a club like atmosphere .The cuisine is rather British classic,too,but  set menus have been introduced,too soften the blow to the wallet.
491;Very special evening with extraordinarily good food! Definitely one of my most favourite meals of all time!
492;Wilton's offers fabulous food, discreet impeccable service and a traditional British environment. I keep going back and recommend it to anyone I know that comes to London.
493;Fantastic food and service in restaurant with great history and ambience.
494;Absolutely amazing! Every time when I come back to Wiltons I fall in love with this place more and more! Food superb, service top class! Without a doubt would recommend this place to anyone who appreciates good food and great atmosphere and service!
495;We went for an end of holiday family meal and loved our experience. It was an expensive night out but well worth it. The service and food were impeccable.
496;Had a fantastic dinner at Wiltons. Great food, great ambiance, and excellent service. It's expensive, but worth the money you spend in my opinion.
497;Although this is the game season, none was on the menu, supposedly due to the holiday. A disappointment.  Likewise,  we are seated  at a small table for two virtually on top of a table with theee loud guests.  Not a comfortable experience.I have been coming here for years. The quality has slipped, although the prices have not.
498;Very  nice food, well presented and lovely flavours.   Good selection of fish, meat & game
499;Can't argue with an institution. Old school dining done properly
500;Everything is perfect. A place you must-try. Food&Elegance. A reference.
501;"I had passed this restaurant many times on Jermyn Street and always wanted to try it, so we finally organised ourselves properly and booked just before Christmas. While small on the outside, the place is like a tardis on the inside and extends to multiple dinning areas/rooms all with a slightly different ambiance. I booked with a request for space since my wife was quite pregnant and needed to ""spread-out"". We were shown to the last dinning room which, at 730pm, was empty and seemed a bit remote. On remarking this, the maitre'd he told us that since we had booked late this was all that was available. I thought this a bit lame considering I had booked in early November but did not mention it. Thankfully this ""error"" was remedied upon his return with the menus when he apologised for the confusion, but that we were placed here because of my request for a bit of space for my wife. As further remedy he offered us a glass of champagne (or orange juice) on the house which was most kind.The place soon filled-up and actually the room was  perfect, containing 4-5 tables with a  lively atmosphere but not too much noise. The other rooms also became full and were a lot more lively but quite noisy. If looking for a catch-up with friends and family, our place was perfect, if looking for a lively night out, the other rooms may better suit if you can talk loudly!The menu was extensive and had options for a good value set-menu, as well as a more pricey a la carte. There was also a ""carving trolley"" which on Saturday night was  Beef Wellington. Unfortunately they were already down to the last 2 pieces which we quickly commandeered so that was it for the rest of the unfortunate diners. We  ""unfortunates"" had fish stew and lamb which could not beat the beef but was still very good. The wine menu was very extensive although I would say a bit pricey. The service was excellent - always there but not over fussy.All in all, our new favourite restaurant in London and sure to return!"
502;Excellent food and impeccable service !!
503;the service and all the staff was excellent and very professional as well as very friendly. the quality of food as well the raw material was top. also the wine list was very good but i would expect more wine labels from   Mediterranean i.e. Greece.any may I would suggest Wilton's to other people for special and not only occasions, indeed is very authentic , traditional and very British.we were a company of five people and we had an excellent time.
504;Old school ambience & food brought up to date a bit without losing the whole point of the Wilton's experience.  A difficult trick but a successful one.
505;"Friendly attentive staff. Delicious fish. Traditional cuisine. Does what it says on the ""tin"""
506;I have been dining at Wiltons for over 20 years in the run up to Christmas, and it does not fail to deliver.  Sadly too many Oligarchs and FTSE 100 Directors now dine there, that Wiltons have increased their menu and especially wine list prices to take advantage, such that you have to depend on a good win on the horses to not baulk at the bill, following an excellent 3 hours of company, food and atmosphere.
507;Wiltons never disappoints - always reliably superb.An expensive class act and so enjoyable.In particular, the service is spot on, as befits such an up market establishment.
508;What is not to like at Wiltons? Quintessential British Ambience, Impeccable Service,Simply Delicious!Request a booth.
509;Wilton's is an historic restaurant and I suspect has not changed much from the early 20th Century. The food is mainly fish and a speciality, very traditional and usually very good, served beautifully albeit often tepid! The service is respectful and efficient .The ambiance is pure period, diners walk into another world, velvet drapes, mirrors, cubicles, white table cloths and old paintings help recapture a bygone age.
510;Absolutely amazing! Love this place! Best oysters! Service  great! I can't fault this place!!
511;Enjoyed a wonderful dinner of caviar, stilton soufflé , one of us had sole and another had halibut - both were cooked perfectly, Brussel sprout leaves, and spica and it all was delicious.
512;Wilton's is a true delight. The food, service, and ambiance are top notch. Absolutely 5 stars.
513;This was the best restaurant experience I have ever had. Everything from the food to the service was perfect. Wiltons makes you feel like a million bucks.
514;"I was treated to a meal at Wiltons  40 years ago; the memory lingered and this week my wife and I decided to give each other to what we confidently expected to be an excellent Christmas treat. We were not disappointed. We both had Dover sole, which was fantastic - but my wife wants to go back tomorrow for a second go at the blackberry soufflé. We will be back soon."
515;My favorite restaurant in London.  I always plan at least one meal at Wilton's on each visit from the States.
516;Wiltons is quintessentially superb. Among the very finest of London's restaurants and the most consistently perfect.
517;Lives up to it's reputation. A classic. Everything spot on.  Faultless service,  a wow for the wine lover... make sure there is plenty of money available on the credit card !!  Only one BUT: A long thin restaurant so not many good tables. You are along the side walls sitting opposite each other.  We were given a table up in the corner.  One looking into the restaurant the other staring at the back wall. No option to move elsewhere.  We changed places half way through the meal. On out next visit  we'll not  go to the restaurant we'll go to a table in the restaurant.
518;I went to Wilton's for a game dinner and for the first time in my life I have eaten a properly cooked grouse. The game consomme' was outstanding and the wild rabbit a rare treat, not I was disappointed at all by the venison fillet. The wine pairing was nicely chosen although not execeptional (and not surprisingly all the wines were French). The staff is extremely kind and professional. They made us feel special guest although for me it was the first time that I went there. I'm looking forward to having the chance to try the a la carte menu.
519;Wow what an evening we had at Wiltons The service, food, atmosphere were all outstanding.We went for a birthday celebration and felt this justified the cost of the meal and numerous drinks!Well worth it and can't wait to go there again
520;Probably the best old school restaurant in London.                                                   Hans Nagar
521;Wiltons food and service is always a joy and my visit was no exception. The wine list is great but pricey
522;We enjoyed a very nice dinner at Wiltons.  It's a London institution and was recommended to us by a friend who is a foodie. I would call the atmosphere formal, but not stuffy. The service is impeccable.  The food was very good, with some interesting options  and the wine list is extremely impressive, although it could benefit from a few more economical choices.  With a shared appetizer, 2 entrees, dessert and a bottle of wine be prepared to spend at least £100/person.
523;High British Cuisine at its best...I Loved the place, the Food and service..... I had the Dressed Crab and the Grouse..... Both lovely dishes.... Highly recomended and simply splendid!
524;I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT YOUR DRESS CODE HAS BEEN FLUSHED DOWN THE LOO. I ENDED UP SITTING NEXT TO SOMEONE WEARING A JUMPER & JEANS. I WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF WEARING A SUIT & TIE
525;We find our evening at Wilton's on every London trip to be a highlight. It embodies the essence of Modern British cooking with beautiful rooms (and a great bar at the entrance) and absolutely exquisite and professional service. The trolley at Lunch or Dinner offers a beautiful dish each night (this night it was a medium rare Rack of Veal) and ordering off the regular menu suggests so many options be it apps (from native oysters through to a simple, gorgeous rocket salad with shaved parmesan) to mains (great, pristine seafood to a perfect Chateaubriand for two)l desserts measure up as well (try the unusual slice of creme brûlée, standing vertical with dots of cream chantilly around). It is expensive but don't we all need a place to celebrate?No place does it better.
526;Leaving the resaurant  feeling that we were there for them rather than that they were there for us is a shame.
527;Excellent food, very attentive service. They will push you to order more to increase your check. We were 5 people. They said We'll bring some side vegetables. They brought enough for 10. Worth a visit, just control the ordering.
528;Everything you would want from a timeless restaurant.
529;Magnificent. Traditional fayre, no unnecessary frills, with friendly but professional service.
530;Traditional and very classy. You will be impressed.
531;Lovely restaurant with great food and service. Very attentive staff. Restaurant had a lovely ambience. Well worth a visit.
532;I did book through you onl to get an email saying that my booking could not be made.  This happened the day  or so after my attempt. I tried again.  I dd not receive a confirmation.  I then booed directly with Wiltons.  Systems problems at you end?
533;Perfect! The service and food could not have been better. The ambiance was all we could have hoped for. A real winner.
534;Wiltons does belong to my favorites. Mainly because of the outstanding quality of the food and drinks served. But also because of the ambience. At Wiltons you may eat and drink in quietness that is more and more rare.
535;Loved it. Could not fault one thing. Staff were lovely,  place was very traditional British. A smart place for an occasion or just a treat
536;Always superb. Everything 'fish/ seafood' is superb. I had oysters and Dover sole. My guest had scallops and lobster. I had a savoury desert - soft roes on toast- that was wonderful. The service was exceptional. By that I mean both efficient and v friendly.  I get fed up with Stuffy service where they look down on you. Our waiter and waitress were so lovely. Tables a decent  distance apart. The downside is that it is expensive. Our bill was £350 for two and we only had the house Chablis. But, hey, it was great and you are a long time dead.
537;Great place for dinner. Excellent food (had a dover sole - outstanding). Very good service. Only the air condition could be little bit less blowing...
538;Wiltons is our favourite restaurant in London and we are a regular in this wonderful establishment. It was absolutely spot on as usual.
539;My Wife and I  had a first class evening most enjoyable
540;Alone in London on the tail end of a business trip and want to dine somewhere special but not feel that you are a table of one? Wiltons, as I discovered, would be the right choice. From being greeted with warmth and familiarity (and I a first-time diner), to being ushered with equal geniality into the good night of Jermyn Street, it was an experience one often wishes for but rarely receives elsewhere.  The service was abundant and attentive, without being too close. It is true that facing the bill can test one's courage and financial planning, however that feeling of utter satisfaction is what ultimately prevails. A selection of 1/2 dozen oysters, followed by the (maître d' recommended, and divine) white truffle infused scrambled eggs started the evening. The main course was grilled Dover sole (off-the-bone, according to the choice given), with a side of French beans. I have not had better. I was not intending for dessert but could not refuse the suggested evening special: berry trifle. Accompanied by a glass of tokay, it was a sweet end to a perfect evening. When next in London with my spouse, I shall return.
541;Food was overall up to expectation. Service very personal and attentive. Something went wrong with our Fish Stew and we ended up waiting over 45 minutes for it. The server did offer us a glass of wine for free. Will go try again.
542;It is nice to know that restaurants such as Wilton's still exist and still keep their standards as high as they must have been in the 18th Century when the restaurant opened.   You are made to feel welcome and cosseted but the service is neither intrusive nor dismissive.  And the food isjust excellent.  Dover sole meuniere is unbelievable !   Don't count calories here or look for the latest food trends.  Just sit back and have a wonderful few hours of dining the way it used to be.
543;Authentic english restaurant, quiet and with a remarkable cuisine and very good service.
544;Great food, service very arrogant and they got it wrong every course.
545;This is my second time having the privilege to dine at Wiltons and it does not disappoint. The service and cuisine are first rate and the single best dining experience I've ever had. It's a shame I live in the US!
546;Wilton's never disappoints it's my favourite restaurant in London. The Lobster Thermidor is heaven on a plate.
547;Traditional restaurant with private banquettes. Very good quality food, mainly fish and game, well cooked. Brilliant but discreet service. Excellent wine list. Not cheap but worth every penny!!
548;Wilton's is my favorite for grouse and oysters.  When I come from America I always look forward to my dinner!
549;We lunched with friends on the seasonal menu and greatly enjoyed the Romney Salt Marsh lamb - it was excellent.  Service was impeccable  - friendly but professional and the waiters were extremely helpful when discussing the menu with my friend who has a chicken allergy. They went out of their way to make sure all courses were enjoyable but safe for her to eat.
550;The Dover sole meunière off the bone was delicious, as was everything else. We loved every minute of our dinner at Wiltons, starting with champagne. It is the best of British restaurant and I will savor the memories of our dinner.
551;Outstanding evening celebrating our twenty-five wedding anniversary
552;Great English cuisine with plenty of history. This is a respectable dignified restaurant where one can have a quiet meal in cosy and private surroundings. The meals are of excellent quality and the service is professional and friendly. If you like English cuisine of game, fish,  a roast of the day, oysters, wild Scottish salmon, this is for you
553;We decided to go to Wilton's for a Saturday night dinner on the recommendation of our hotel concierge and based on other Open Table reviews. My wife and I wanted the dinner to be special as it was Saturday night and her first visit to London foe the US. Wilton's did not disappoint. My wife ordered fish and I had lamb. Both prepared properly and well. Service and ambiance was excellent. We had a very nice corner table for the two of us. Everything was just very nice and we would certainly return and recommend Wilton's to others. 5 stars.
554;Excellent meal in a traditional civilised ambience.
555;"The problem was that they made a big mistake on the bill, 100 pounds more, three plates that we don't eat,  and they didn't say ""sorry"" when we asked to do the exact bill: at least we paied the exact amount: 200 pounds, that is not so economy! So read your bill if you go there, put your attention!!! May be they do it often with tourists!!!!"
556;Nice restaurant that I used to visit a long time ago and had good memories of. We were stuck in a very poor table this time though. It felt like an extra table stuck against the back wall between a booth and a corner table. The two blokes in the booth probably found it more uncomfortable than I did, having to discuss their medical problems when I was sitting closer to one of them than they were to each other. Odd, because there were other tables and booths that weren't taken all lunchtime. Maybe you have to be a regular, or call them when you book and see if there's a good table available.
557;Wiltons was a great please to both myself and my wife. We had the two course special menu which was both excellent and quite filling, this did not stop me from ordering a welsh rarebit to finish with--outstanding. The service was attentive respectful for us both surprisingly friendly.Ah but then simple things done very well really do please, we left with smiles
558;We enjoyed a lovely evening with two courses and glass of champagne, the starters were excellent, classic oysters or delicious smoked salmon.Main courses were very good although we still had to order sides as no vegetables came with the dishes.Service was wonderfully unobtrusive.My only complaint would be the air conditioning was on a little high making the restaurant a touch chilly.
559;Not dined here for a few years but it has retained that special something.One slight, and very slight criticism would be the close proximity of other tables.Overall it's still excellent.
560;Had never been before, and was surprised by how big the interior was, and what good value the set lunch was (inc a free glass of fizz). Oysters possibly best ever had.
561;Somehow I've never before eaten at Wiltons. Though I was slightly disappointed to find only a single waitress, the male waiters were all superb. Our waiter suggested different varieties of rock oysters to fit the taste of each of two of us, and he was dead right, as was the wine waiter's suggestion of the burgundy. The grouse was unhung (or briefly hung: it was, after all, the 15th of August) and perfect.
562;Classic British food served in quiet, elegant surroundings with an emphasis on seafood.Selection of oysters and roast beef cooked to perfection were the highlights for us.Lovely, friendly staff made it a very enjoyable evening.
563;It's really a wonderful and good restaurant , the food is good , the Place is elegant
564;A warm but not effusively welcome begins a lovely evening.   I'd eat at Wilton's  once a week if only the bank balance wouldn't say ouch.
565;Excellent choice for a business meal, possible to have a conversation without the struggle to hear what your companion is saying across the table. First class service and good food.  Good value set menu with ample choices.
566;We have been eating at Wilton's for 20 years.  It is always an early dining destination on our regular trips to London.  All well done, but it is expensive.  John Y ChristopherFairhope,  Alabama
567;Wonderful from the minute you enter to the minute you leave.  We eat out at least 3 times a week and have done for over 20 years.  We really try to go to new places as London has somany fantastic restaurants and we like to try as many as we can.  Wiltons is one we goback to regularly.  It should be number one in London.
568;We enjoyed our visit very much, but we have been before, the service is five stars, very nice staff, and polite, nothing is a problem for them, the food is expensive but good quality, the drinks are expensive, glass  of Champaign is £14.50.  Try the beef Wellington on the trolley, it's superb,    We will be going again,  as we like the venue ..
569;Well  a very nostalgic setting of a by gone day.   Charming friendly service .   A great open table deal.
570;Perfect elegant old fashioned English lunch venue.We had a set lunch. Did exactly what they said on the tin. Quality of everything was outstanding. Best Lemon Sole I have ever eaten but shame they didn't include any vegetables with the main course
571;Excellent all round! Classic but not pretentious. Thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience at Wiltons.
572;It was our first time at Wiltons and we were not disappointed.  The service was superb, you get a sense that customer service is a big priority, the food was very good and the ambience excellent. A great British restaurant with great tradition. I will be going back and highly recommend anyone to go.
573;We went for the 2 courses & a glass of champagne for £30. The main course came with no vegetables so these were extra. I chose the fish course which was far too salty.  For two of us the bill came to much more than the expected £60!
574;The service is fantastic and the food are delicious.
575;I wanted to pass on my thanks to the Maître de for an excellent table and service on my visit for a business lunch on 29th July.
576;One of the best dining experiences ever. Not only very professional , but although very polite and friendly. The menue and the wine list are very impressive, the quality is impressive and the prices are worth it.Thank you very much for two unforgetable evenings.
577;I have been eating at Wiltons for 20 years. It is quite simply the best restaurant in the world.
578;Excellent friendly service, great wines and tasty food in a lovely environment. Really enjoyed our night out.
579;Wilton's is wonderful- I love the tradition/history it is steeped in while being food heaven.
580;Very welcoming efficient and comfortable experience
581;I try to eat at Wilton's every time I am in London. Always a great meal.
582;A welcoming staff always makes it worth a visit. Stephan is wonderful and very knowledgeable about his wine.
583;My favorite restaurant: perfect food, unobtrusive and attentive service, ideal ambiance.  Outstanding as usual.  Thank you.
584;"Expected the Dover Sole to be the best I'd ever had;  it wasn't dreamy.Pretentious service.I'd go back to there bar and something to eat there."
585;As usual this is a very special restaurant  - food is excellent and the service first class - my guest is disabled and the staff looked after him so well
586;It has been a long time since I have enjoyed a restaurant as much as this one. The food was excellent and the service superb. Can't wait to go again!
587;early dinner ...6pm --- we noticed other being offered a Trolley option but only about 7pm - shame we were not offered it.....waiter took our order for cocktails but forgot 1 of the drinks ? poor when we were there early and it was not busy...cheese board was very good but portions small  and the waiter forgot to bring the crackers - the wine service was good - all in all for nearly 500 pounds for 3 at a business dinner - there are sadly better places and with better seating ...we were squashed between a  two couples  -  almost touching the arms of one of the guests.......sorry it was good but not value for money -- the staff were not top notch at service and several were smoking outside when we arrived around 6pm and then served us 15 mins later ! finally the mains were all very good Dover Sole (but served on a very small plate) the Beef Fillet was excellent as was the Lamb according to my guests - again the prices were at the high end........On the Californian Reds very dissapointed selection (less than 10 bottles and most were 500 pds or more?) Rioja only 2 bottles I could  see ? overall 7 out of 10. Sorry.
588;Picked this restaurant so a business associate from New York could get a taste of fine British cuisine and etiquette, we were pleased with everything from the food, wine, service and ambience. Easy to see why Wilton's is a legend, looking forward to going again soon.
589;This is my favourite restaurant in the world. Normally it is impeccable but on this occasion it was marred by poor fish. On other visits the Turbot has been superb but this time was overcooked and nt pleasant. I mentioned this to staff but they seemed uninterested.
590;I had a fabulous time at Wiltons, it was my first visit and my birthday. I had the langoustine caught fresh and the lobster and crab omelette. Everything was delicious, however I did tell one of the waiters on leaving that my spinach, served with the omelette, was too salty.The service was excellent, the starter and main course specials were brought around to the table which made you more tempted to try them. It was very busy with a business / political crowd and the atmosphere was buzzing.I enjoyed my visit very much and I will go back with my husband for lunch.
591;What ever the occasion Wilton's will always make it special. The staff are attentive but never intrusive and the food is excellent. British dining at its very best.
592;"My wife and I met in London for five nights and Wilton's was put on the ""to do"" list while there. This was the first time we had been to Wilton's and we were both very impressed with the whole experience. We have a local favorite near our home in the United States, but Wilton's has become one of, if not the best, dining experiences we have had."
593;We had an excellent birthday lunch.  Service and food was exceptional.  Staff were all very friendly with particular thanks to Alina who made our lunch very special.
594;The food was excellent and the service was exceptional. One does not often find premier, and yes, old school service in today's restaurants. While the ambiance was warm and welcoming, it was the service that gave it a formal feel, yet made for a relaxing evening with good conversation while enjoying outstanding food that was well-presented. It is now among the top on our London restaurant list!
595;We had pre-theatre at Wilton's.  The dining room was mostly empty at that early hour.  The seafood is truly outstanding and the service, although formal, was quite warm after we engaged with several staff members.  We were especially thrilled that one of the managers supported the same football team as us.  The staff were aware of our theater plans and paced the delicious meal perfectly.  Our impression is that the team at Wilton's run their restaurant well and we would happily return.
596;The evening spent at WIltons was as usual outstanding. The service, the quality of the food and the way it is served. I totally love this place with its slightly old-fashioned manners and still a menu for today's people.
597;Superb food and wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable staff in a very comfortable setting.  The style is a little old fashioned but in a very re-assuring way. Long may it continue!
598;Quintessential English dining with impeccable service.
599;Lovely old world dining experience. Superb service. AMAZING cherry stone clams!!
600;Very nice place in a classic style. Food and wines a excellent.  Must visit!
601;Very classic style and beautiful restaurant. There weren't many diners at the time as we ate fairly early at 5.30pm so it was nice and quiet, just what my companion and I hoped for. The waiter even asked if we had somewhere to be so that they'd be aware of timings (I had planned a trip to the theatre so that was a nice touch). Service was top class and the food sublime. I ordered the cheese soufflé to start and the grilled lemon sole as a main which were both fantastic. This was followed by dessert of gariguette strawberry crumble with lemon verbena ice cream, a wonderful end to a memorable meal. Everything was light and fresh. I had also mentioned that the meal was for a birthday and the waitress came out with a plate of sensational chocolates with 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate sauce on the dish. They were so good I asked if they sold them! Unfortunately the restaurant only makes them in-house especially for their guests. A perfect end to our Wilton's experience. Despite being time-conscious for the theatre, we both enjoyed our time there and would definitely go again.
602;We were guests at the Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace on the afternoon and we wanted something special to complete this special day.On many occasions, when we have visited London, we have always said that we should go to Wiltons but always seemed to run out of time. On this occasion we made sure that we did not miss our chance.We had an excellent positioned table in the corner of the room and could watch the pure theatre of the evening as it progressed.The food exceeded our expectations and the service and attention to detail were second to none. I am sure that it will not be too long before we return.
603;As always, this restaurant excels in virtually every category.  The food is excellent as is the service.  Everything very well organized....our table has always been ready when we arrive.  Very nice staff.
604;I  booked for my  husband's birthday  because he loves seafood but I'm not so keen. He was thrilled with the food, I had lamb !We have been to many fine dining restaurants and found that this was very different, the service was excellent and the waiters were relaxed ( and smiling), but they were also very  professional.A very  enjoyable evening, would go again !
605;I go to Wilton's once a year when I am in London.    The special smoked salmon is the best I have had, anywhere.  The service and food are always excellent.  When I am alone, I enjoy eating at the bar and watching the skills of the bartender and the gentleman who prepares the salmon and oysters.   Of London's traditional restaurants, I like Wilton's the best.
606;Absolutely loved this restaurant, staff were incredible and the food was on point.I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good food!!!
607;Outstanding food, service
608;We came to eat lobster was missing.The same dessert with a rhubarb.We had to order just starters were the worst.Recommend not to come to this restaurant.
609;Wiltons is a nice place to dine and very peaceful and quiet. It's not cheap, but nice for that special occasion.
610;"Wiltons is a very good restaurant.  The food and service is excellent. I had Dover Sole, which is a special treat.  They surprised me a bit by offering chicken as a special, but aside from surprise it looked very good.  My wife had fish also and I had the best ever cherrystones for an appetizer (I mean really really meaty and tasty).I have two issues, but I don't want to make too much of them.  One is that the room gets a bit crowded.  Had we one of the three booths we could have been more comfortable, but the other tables are too close to each other and to the service table and you flinch when they push the trolley through to show the specials and to carve.  However, I still prefer the room beyond the bar to the other room.  The other is that the wait staff ""sells"" a bit too strongly.  All in all a fine dinner and a fine evening."
611;There is no question that Wilton's is a world class restaurant--gracious, friendly service with subtle ambience and outstanding quality food.
612;"We always enjoy this great restaurant and find it hard to fault.  This time I was a bit miffed when my guest simply asked for a glass of merlot and they handed him one for £26 (small glass). Without realising I said ""make it a bottle and we'll share it"" and that more than doubled the cost of our lunch.  I'll take more care with my choice of wine next time."
613;Wilton's has a long history and it was clear why when my husband and I had a special meal there on Saturday evening.  Right from the moment we stepped through the door, we received exceptional service, yet immediately felt comfortable due to the friendliness of the staff.Tomasso and his team ensured that we had a lovely evening - service was attentive, yet unrushed.  The food was fabulous - in particular the Beef Wellington, which was delicious, and we had some great wine advice to ensure that what we drank complemented the food.Surroundings are very comfortable and the evening flew by.  We will definitely be returning.Thank you.
614;"We were a Group of 4 people Saturday night. Expectations were high.  As a starter oeysters, salmon and champagne . Followed by Beef Wellington and lobster. Nothing to complain about the food; Sharp kitchen, fresh ingredients... But as we waited for the desserts a waiter placed a glass of dessertwine in front of the three of us and a glass of cola in front of our teenagedaughter. We thought it was a glass of complementary wine, but after several minutes without any of us had touched the glasses except for our daughter another waiter came along, removed the glasses from our table and served them for some other guests at our nabouring table, leaving us astonished  while he at the same time asked us if we weren´t surprised? Surprised of his behaviour or the  sudden change in the service and attitude as if we had done anything wrong ? At a total bill of GBP 615 we were embaressed and does not find price and service matching. we will not come back!"
615;WE WANTED TO FIND THE BEST RESTAURANT OFFERING DOVER SOLE  IN LONDON AND INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS  INDICATED WILTON'S. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED AND LOOKING AT THE QUALITY AND EXCELLENT MENU WE WILL RETURN.ATMOSPHERE REFINED BUT VERY FRIENDLY OFFERING A HIGH GRADE OF SERVICE.I COULDN'T FIND ANY FLAWS. EXCELLENT RAPPORT PRICE/QUALITY.
616;Meal ruined by couple with child put next to us. More the mother's  fault than the child's, who encouraged the child to sing at the top of her voice. throughout our meal.We arrived at 5.15pm for an early meal pre-theatre dinner to be told that the carpet was being hoovered and could we come back in 15mins, so we walked around in the rain until 5.30pm.Wilton's needs to decide if it's a family friendly restaurant or a fine dining experience for the over 12's.
617;It was our first night in London and we couldn't have asked for a better way to start our vacation. We felt so welcome and the welcome continued throughout the meal. We will definitely return before going back to USA.
618;The food at Wilton's is of the highest quality. My Dover sole was excellent although at £46 is should be! Service was attentive and helpful.  Wilton's relies on regulars and won American I met had been going there for 40 years! The dining room is a little starchy and will need to modernise if it is to attract a new generation of customers.
619;As usual everything was excellent. Food, service and wine were all first class. It's not cheap but it is very very good.
620;Just got the set menu bream and cheese platter. Cheese plate is always good.
621;"Still  best seafood in town but decor and ambiance dying breed. Rock steady in offerings butlunch would have been better as usually very busy that time of day so more ambiance and would be better valueIf looking for ""fun"" this isn't for you"
622;i have always loved Wiltons ever since my grandfather took me there over 30 years ago. its a London institution.
623;The ambience is old school  without the stuffiness. The food was excellent although the sole was a tad buttery and the dessert too chilled. But all in all, an outstanding meal for a special occasion. We will return again next year.
624;As usual a delightful and relaxing experience - the dishes are superb and the service first class
625;Lovely restaurant - restful, seating comfortable and tables well spaced for privacy, waiting staff were excellent - attentive but not intrusive.  Food was excellent - a la carte menu is very expensive, but we had the set menu, which included the carvey trolley, which was more reasonably priced, and it was lovely to have the lamb carved at the table.  All in all, a lovely dining experience for a special occasion.
626;I have been lunching and dining at Wiltons for The staff are always helpful, attentive and above all discreet.
627;Excellent food, well prepared and estetically presented. Great wine collections, and stylish service in a cozy ambience. This all comes at the high London dining price, but you definitely get what you pay for!
628;This was our first visit to Wiltons and it certainly won't be our last! The restaurant had a lovely traditional atmosphere and style and the staff were incredibly welcoming. The menu had an excellent choice and the food was amazing. The cheese souffle was the best I've ever tasted and the beef Wellington was to die for! Can't wait to return!
629;Excellent both food and service.  Perfect for the quintessential British experience.
630;It has not been our first time at Wiltons Restaurant on Jermyn Street. The cosy yet modern atmosphere, the attention of the whole staff, the high quality of the products used, the vast wine list and last but not least the friedliness are overwhelming. The carving trolly and the seasonal menu are highly recommendable. The food was absolutely stunning and its presentation awesome. The waiters and Nannies do ther absolutely best to please one. Everything is very stylish,: The guests, the decoration and the treatment.  I highly recommend this extroadinary absolutely fantastic experience. It's also like travelling through time in its best sense.
631;We took the seasonal menu which included a very nice glass of champagne and two courses. We had booked for Monday lunch as Romney Marsh lamb is usually on the menu on that day. Unfortunately it had run out so we were unable to try but had a beautifully cooked braised beef with winter veg. The smoked salmon and turnip soup starters were also delicious. Overall, despite the lack of lamb, it was a lovely meal.
632;Haven't been to Wilton's for years and my husband never had, we were very pleasantly surprised. Food was fantastic and the service especially the wine waiter was excellent. Busy but not too noisy and with a genuine feel that they were trying to ensure every guest had a great evening.
633;Lovely restaurant and good service with nice food. Look forward to the next visit.
634;"I reserved personally this restaurant to celebrate my birthday and it was a mistake. I was expecting a real British place but the whole experience was disappointing. To start with, sorry to say that the maids dressed in  greenish uniform were so sad; the service was poor for such an expensive place; my entreè dish (scallpos) was badly cooked and unpleasant taste. No atmosphere at all. The 2 only positive elements were the nice and attentive sommelier - I really appreciated his professional and friendly approach- and the very good grilled Dover sole.In conclusion, too expensive for what I received both in terms of food and ambiance."
635;Lovely food and great service. We did not feel at all rushed though we were almost the last to leave.
636;Wilton's in the evening is every bit as good as it is during the day - attentive but not overpowering service, wonderful fish, great wine and a relaxed and very British atmosphere. Great experience
637;Perhaps expensive but almost worth it would be  better. We really enjoyed our dinner and the food, service and ambience was to be recommended. It was a splurge as was confirmed when the bill came. Worth it? well yes and the next time we visit London we will be back.
638;Fantastic evening, great old school fine dining, we loved it and will be back of course
639;The Venison was outstanding and service exellent.Always enjoy
640;Quintessentially British is the only way to describe Wiltons. The atmosphere is generally good but on this occasion was slightly marred by the fact that some of the serving staff had congregated near us on the restaurant floor and were happily chatting away with each other. This was distracting and not the sort of behaviour expected in a decent restaurant. I am sure this was a one off as I have previously eaten here and have never seen that occur before. Perhaps it was a case of 'while the cats away the mice will play' that night. Other than that, exceptional food as always.
641;Wiltons never fails to deliver in terms of food and service. Excellent all round.
642;One of the best restaurants in London
643;I admire the profile of Wiltons where you never flirt with Italian or French tradition but boldly stick to the British, made with great competence and capacity. For instance the irresistable Bread-and-butter-pudding!
644;Wiltons is a charming, elegant restaurant with good extensive menu option. The service and staff is always excellent.
645;Endive salad came without the dressing and staff had to be reminded of this.No apology for this oversight. Also it took some time to actually get the dressing.Food was at best mediocre and seriously over pricedWe were told that we would be getting Petit Fours with our coffee. None arrived and we had to once again remind them of what was missing.There is a veneer of service and food quality but it is at best patchyBasically, I can see no reason whatsoever to pay £75 per head with no wine for what we received.Wiltons is definitely worth a miss as there are many other restaurants of it's type that charge the same but include excellent service and top quality food.
646;Had a lovely evening at Wilton's, well looked after, the food was superb and made special as it was a birthday celebration and Wilton's made it special and looked after us very well
647;Excellent as always
648;Wiltons is a welcoming restaurant with good food. I didn't find the food innovative or exciting but it was good. Great service. Lovely champagne to start with. I had a great evening with the opentable offer but I don't think it is worth paying full price for. Plenty of other more interesting restaurants in London.
649;Excellent all round experience, great game and meat suitable to the season. I had the goose and it was very good. Lived up the to  last visit in the Spring when gulls egg were on the menu.   Slick staff.
650;Wilton is one of our favourite restaurants in London.  The food is delicious and service impeccable.  This restaurant is for people who appreciate good food served by amazingly well trained personnel.  If you like traditional roasts, game and seafood this is the restaurant for you. I strongly recommend this restaurant.
651;"From start to end this was a great dinner. Faultless dinner  of traditional favourites. Service was professional but very friendly. Even got a little extra of the wonderful caramel and sea salt ice cream as ""seconds"". Yes it is pricey but you are getting excellent food as a result in an unrushed ambience -none of the ""you can only have the table for two hours"" nonsense."
652;"The warmest of welcomes, everybody friendly, comfortable seating, good acoustics, delicious food, expert sommelier with sensible suggestions, and the bill comes quickly when you ask for it.  Yes, it may cost more than average, but you if you are lucky enough to be able to dine in the best place in London; don't quibble!"
653;beautifully cooked and presented courses.  Fallow Deer was 1st class as was the fresh fruit salad.  Great range of wines.
654;A very attentive staff, wonderful service. We had the lobster bisque and oysters and sad to say it was all abit plain. For maincourse we had lobster-that was much better as the truffles we got with dessert.
655;They have excellent food, mainly fish and oysters but we oredered game and it was very good , as well.Service was very attentive and knowledgeable.
656;not inexpensive but worth every penny, really you have to write 50 characters
657;Wiltons is my favourite. Superb oysters. The rest of the menu is accomplished and never, never disappoints. We stuck with champagne because we were on a budget but really with a wine list like they have, the sky is the limit. As for the service, absolutely wonderful. It doesn't matter what you wear, they look after you like an old, treasured guest. I'd go again, and again.
658;As usual high standard food and service in this very special restaurant
659;Have wanted to dine at Wiltons for a long time and the wait was worth it.  Had a super, last-minute lunch and it lived up to all expectations.  Super staff, outstanding food and excellent ambience.  I can't fault anything from start to finish and will be back as soon as waistline permits.
660;Another classic lunch at Wiltons. Efficient, friendly service. Relaxed atmosphere and exquisite food. Faultless.
661;We went to the restaurant for dinner for a birthday celebration on the deal of 2 courses for £30 or three courses for £38 from the set menu.We were disappointed to find that the only meat option on the set menu carried a supplement of £10 per person.We were told that the main course would come with a selection of vegetables but we were not informed that there would be an additional charge for the vegetables.Given that we were choosing from a set menu an additional charge for vegetables seemed inappropriate.What began as 2 courses for £30 quickly became 2 courses for circa £45.There was no house wine on the wine list and the cheapest bottle of wine was £35.We consider that the offer of 2 courses for £30 was misleading and we left the restaurant feeling disappointed.
662;For a special treat, Wilrons was a great experience for our family. Staff very attentive without intruding, great food, historic environment, wine a little on the expensive side, but other than that it was faultless
663;"An elegant restaurant, lovely ambiance, outstanding service...albeit with prices to match.We had a lovely meal and were pleased that they were able to accommodate my husband's requirement for a gluten free meal. He enjoyed his butternut squash soup and our mains were excellent. My husband had grilled halibut; my scallops were huge and perfectly prepared.Service was flawless and they accommodated our schedule, as we had tickets for a performance after dinner.This was one of our first and certainly one of our loveliest meals in our one-week stay in London."
664;I have been at the WIlton's regularly for many years and never been disappointed. Above all the food is of first class, old-fashioned British food. The Service is of the same class and the atmosphere in the restaurant gives me only good feelings.
665;From the moment of entry Wiltons cossets you like few other restaurants. Not inexpensive but you get what you pay for: faultless service, excellent traditional and unpretentious food and a good wine choice. On the day, a 'special' of venison en croutes was outstanding, as was the cheese board afterwards. Classic.
666;Wiltons is off the beaten track but well worth finding. The food and service were excellent. The only critique  is that our booking was for 1.15pm and when ordering they had already sold out of the carvery trolly special on the set menu. An alternative meat was offered but settled for the sole which was delicious.
667;Come in off Jermyn St.  and be welcomed  warmly at Wilton's, the perfect restaurant serving excellent English food with service to match.
668;"Dover Sole Meunière was spot on. It would have been better presentation-wise if they had dressed it table side.Been dining with Wiltons since mid 80s when my father first took me; never disappointed."
669;"My husband and I went for the prix fix lunch offered though an Open Table booking - 3 courses and a Bellini for 38 GBP.  We both had the smoked salmon starter and the carvery (ham and mashed).  He selected a custard for dessert and I had the cheese plate.   The salmon was sublime - lightly smoked, delicate and delicious.  The carvery was spectacular!  Perfectly prepared gammon with a cherry compote and mashed potatoes.   Portions were large.  I was able to select 4 cheeses from a cart offering 10-15 options.  The cheese was served with an assortment of biscuits, quince and a fruit jam.  A perfect ending to a delicious meal.  The bill came to 120 GBP - the additional amount due to 2 martinis (perfectly prepared) and 2 glasses of red wine.  There was a mix up with the price of the wine - we ordered a Semillion priced at 16 GBP/glass but received a much finer wine priced at 50 GBP/glass.  When we mentioned this to the server, he honored the lower price which was a totally classy move (and a relief!)  Service was attentive, friendly and efficient.  The noise level is a bit high.  The décor very ""clubby"" English.  If you can, reserve a table in a booth - they looked a bit quieter and super special.  I got the feeling the regulars sit there.   This a British institution and not to be missed during a trip in London.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"
670;Staff are friendly, simple well cooked fish. Don't expect nouvelle cuisine! Fish cooked as it should be. It  has great atmosphere dinning as it was. Not inexpensive but the overall experience worth the price.
671;Visited Wiltons on Opentable 3 courses with glass of champagne or Bellini option £38 pp. Menu choices for all courses were good and service discretely efficient.  Our sitting was booked for 9pm on a midweek night yet the restaurant was still busy and the patrons were not mainly tourists.  Seating layout is not too intimate and booths add option for more privacy if preferred. Breads, smoked salmon starter, plaice main with veg and coffee and chocolate fondant dessert all well presented and generous portions unlike some special menus which sell short. This restaurant has a long history and still retains old style dining propriety and a deserved reputation for enjoyable cuisine. The full menu was not considered on this occasion but if dining earlier or on a special occasion would have been most inviting - albeit at a considerably higher price.  A good evening, will be back.
672;My husband and I had been travelling in Europe for over a month.  Even without a jacket and tie, which predominated, we were cordially accepted.  The service and atmosphere were exemplary.  We ordered the special of the day, which was our favourite  British meal,  of roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.  We were not disappointed, it was excellent.  I endorse this restaurant most highly.
673;"Wiltons as usual is a must for every visit to London.  I have been there many times and it was always a wonderful experience. Unfortunately this time we had got a ""hidden""table at a corner, despite having made the booking weeks before. I wanted to show my friends one of the top restaurants of London but we could see nothing !! Of course we were best dressed and well behaved but ""put aside"" probably because we made the booking from Austria and not from London (Tourist ???)When I lived in London and made the booking from there, I always got a nice table. I should have complained about the bad table but did not want to make a fuss in such a noble restaurant. The food was excellent as usual, the service as well and had we seen something of the restaurant instead of having been boxed into the booth next to the kitchen door, it would have been the highlight of our trip.  However, still a wonderful experience and best food !"
674;Excellent service from friendly and attentive staff. Blue cheese soufflé to start was amazing and the venison Wellington special was utterly outstanding. I wouldn't hesitate in returning to Wiltons again.
675;If you wanted to be treated like a second class citizen than dine at Wiltons.  They will shuttle you from one bad table to the next if you are not a part of some elite few that they deem worthy, and then serve you mediocre food at best, for more than £150 per person.This is everything that is horrid about London.
676;Very old fashioned decor gives Wilton's restaurant a bygone feel. I felt like it had an old gents club feel to it. Whist this was interesting, it was a bit stuffy and not as stylish as some other high end restaurants I've been to in London. The service and food was very good in general, except for our deserts (we both had apple and plum crumble), which were average. In summary, we enjoyed ourselves, but in rating our experience, Wilton's takes it's place behind some seriously high competition from London's other fine dining restaurants.
677;Very classy and upscale restaurant. Unique English atmosphere and ambiance. Would recommend if you want to spend money and have a special meal.
678;Service excellent, food very good, even the sole housing were fresh, fleshy and well cooked.  The ambience is in need of an upgrade, looks and feels like a gentlemens club from the 70's, everything looks tired.  The big downside, price!  48 pounds for sole goujons!   At that price they can afford to redecorate!
679;Once again Wiltons provided an outstanding meal. Service was excellent, ambience great, highly recommended. Not cheap, but food and service of this quality necpver is.
680;Feels more like a gentleman's club than a restaurant. Some younger diners might fell a bit out of place. However if you want to be spoilt over  a long, relaxed lunch with quite refined cooking this is a splendid place for those with quite deep pockets.
681;Classic service and impeccable food. Wiltons remains the top place for lunch...
682;Lovely setting, amazing history and exceptional service. It's all great but the food. Bland, mediocre and exceptionally over-priced it's hard to justify spending your dining dollar here when London as so many other exceptional spots. Give it a pass until they hire a chef.
683;Solid British food in conservative quiet at high prices
684;Had game dish grouse. Very delicious. Good service.
685;We ate early on Monday evening - the restaurant was almost empty, so lacking in a bit of atmosphere. We chose from the seasonal set menu (£30 for two courses with a glass of champagne). The main course was very good, but we needed a couple of vegetable side orders as well. But we all agreed that the desserts (granny smith apple and gooseberry crumble and trifle) were excellent.Wine a bit pricey., but all in all a very good meal.
686;"Wiltons is an Institution  where the great and good of British society have dined including Prime Ministers, politicians, royalty, film stars.  The layout of the restaurant lends itself to plotting a take over bid by CEOs or to practice some Machievellian manoeuvres if you are a politician as the tables are widely spaced and some are privatised in wood and etched glass booths.  We had a few glasses of good quality champagne   The table and glasses were beautifully set on freshly laundered table linen.  We skipped the starters.  My companion had the beef medium rare though he was almost tempted by the beef Wellington being served on the next table.  The beef was cooked to perfection accompanied by sides of cauliflower cheese and mushrooms.  I had the vegetarian option.  A delicious vegetarian tart; pastry beautifully cooked, slightly crispy accompanied with celeriac   We shared a trifle but unusually the trifle had no custard but consisted of cream and freshly cut strawberries with raspberries - not a trifle as such.   We paid £108 including service.  It was worth every penny as the service was superb, ambience; good quality ingredients in well executed dishes.  A wonderful restaurant for special occasions or to bring someone special in your life to dine"
687;We had a lovely evening. We felt exstreamly well looked after and the food was fantastic Thank you for a great evening
688;magic atmosphere, kind staff and fantastic food. we had the typical grouse and the lobster omelette. also desserts were very special and delicious
689;Whenever we go to Wilton's it feels like we are coming home. The attention and care of the staff is reminiscent of an age gone by and the personal welcome sets this restaurant apart from all other restaurants we know in London. And by the way, don't miss out on  the amazing Stilton souffle or Devonshire crab! To die for!
690;Service and people were amazing, thank you all! (special thanks to the sommelier!)
691;Food is superb, service outstanding.  But it is not cheap, although local rivals Bentley's & Green's aren't cheap either.  It's a quieter, more private venue than the other two.  I will return but likely sit at the bar for oysters.
692;This restaurant has a unique feel to it and no sense of modernity at all.  Super food, good wine list and very pleasant staff.
693;Impeccable service and very good value on the £30 set menu.  We had the slow roasted gammon with Madeira sauce , it can't be beaten.
694;What a great place to eat for a special occasion. The traditional decor added to the ambiance of the dining experience. The service was excellent, staff were attentive without being over bearing and the food was outstanding. The lemon sole fillet was one of the best fish dishes I have eaten. It was cooked perfectly and had a lovely balance of delicate flavors.  A great selection of wine and digestives to finish off a special evening.
695;A dinner for four with friends we had not seen in a while. Brilliant food, including an excellent vegetarian option, and very pleasant service. An exemplary evening.
696;Top Notch service, Top Notch food, Top Notch evening.  We opted for the fixed price menu (3 x courses £38 inc a Bellini) and each course for both of us was sublime. Great value, I can't fault Wilton's in any way. .......................I'll be back!
697;Very good oysters. A part of that, good ambience with regular food.
698;Great food and ambiance. Very attentive service when you walk into restaurant. Best oyster so far in London. As well as every day prepared trolly meat. Set menu is great value, Nono of the food you choose would disappointed you. This is our second time being there. We will definitely become a regular customers.
699;From the moment we walked into the restaurant we were treated like VIP's.  Everything was absolutely wonderful and the wait staff could not have been more accommodating.  This was a wonderful dining experience.
700;Wonderful seafood with impeccable service and excellent wine list
701;Everyting in Wiltons is always amazing!!!  __ The seasonal menu has hight quality and the prize is really good!!! The desserts are delicious!!!!  The service always great!!! And the ambience nice!!! I am gonna to come back soon!!!!
702;Great place for a celebration meal or wanting to try fine dining.
703;Wiltons is Wiltons but you don't expect to wait over an hour for the main course at 1900 on a Wednesday evening. Lots of waiting staff but no compensation for our long wait. And be prepared to spend at least £60 on a bottle of wine, which seems a little excessive, even for Mayfair.
704;"I first went to Wiltons nearly 50 years ago.  My wife was about to give birth to our first child, and my lunch guest insisted that I should take a ""care package"" from Wiltons when I visited her in hospital.  They provided a lovely box with smoked salmon sandwiches on brown bread and other goodies.  She was delighted to receive it instead of the rather bland hospital food.On the 2nd June we returned to celebrate my wife's 72nd birthday.  We were put in a bankete, which was very special, and had a wonderful meal.  The bill came to over £200, but it was well worth it for the food, the service and the ambiance.  We shall return, but only for very special occasions."
705;"We loved our old-school lunch, all timber and leather and deep carpet and silver carving trolley, and hushed tones. The set lunch deal is good value, but we didn't watch the wine prices so still paid more than we'd planned. Oysters, of course; he had the carving trolley (lamb) and I the fish; then I luxuriated in the most perfect passionfruit souffle. Could it it get any better? I didn't think so, until some complimentary petit fours that exploded in our mouths. Thank you, Wiltons, for a special part of our London holiday."
706;We had a lovely meal at Wiltons choosing from the spring set menu with 3 courses. I had the beef Wellington from the carvery trolley (£10 supplement) and it was delicious. The fillet melted in the mouth and the pastry wasn't soggy at all. In fact, all the food was wonderful and the service was very good without being intrusive. Some of the tables are quite close together but other than that, we had a very enjoyable evening.
707;A really excellent business dinner - quiet, efficient service, wonderful food. And a very nice ambiance about the restaurant.
708;Our last night In London and we wanted to end it with a great meal. At Wilton's we were not disappointed. One of the top 10 dining experiences EVER.  Fabulous oysters, And unbelievably great preparation of Dover Sole.  The service and ambience were wonderful.  Do not miss the chance to experience London dining at its best!
709;It is a long time since I have been to Wiltons which means that sadly I had forgotten just how damn good it is. I'm sure they do not need any good reviews from me but they can have one anyway. Just go if you like superb food and service. It is one of a kind.
710;Dined on Saturday which is probably a different clientele from midweek. The staff were attentive, helpful friendly and professional. The food was generally very good although my wife ordered fried Plaice and was surprised when it arrived in breadcrumbs the menu did not mention this. The fish was good, although the pile of discarded breadcrumbs on the side of the plate caused some dismay to enquiring staff. My Turbot was superb.The wine list is very comprehensive, with something to fit all pockets.The prices are high but I knew that before I went. The v.casual dress of some diners was not what I expected. I'm probably a bit conservative and it was Saturday evening.
711;We always book at Wilton's when in London.  It is so consistent and traditional.  We are from the U.S. and Wilton's  is always a pleasure!  Highest quality and superb service.
712;Shame about the wine list... Which doesn't cater for a wide range of pockets..!! Generally all very expensive which spoils the experience as the food we thought was very reasonably priced for the quality!!!
713;i had a great meal of oysters followed by kidneys. the staff were excellent and the service exemplary
714;"Classic rather than old fashioned, but clearly the kind of place which prides itself on providing excellent service and beautifully prepared food.  I'd say take your parents/future inlaws as it's the kind of place where people have polite conversations in hushed tones.  very ""grown up"" and definitely not raucous but sometimes that's exactly what you want."
715;Everytime I am in Lonon I make it a point to eat at Wiltons and I am never dissapointed.  The food and the staff are the best.  Thank you for the wonderful oysters.
716;Went here to celebrate a birthday with family. Wonderful, comfy booth. Fresh oysters shucked by a master and tasty traditional English menu. The service was very good, attentive and food/drinks arrived in timely manner. Would definitely go here again .
717;Outstanding food outstanding service love it every time I go there
718;What to say - the food, the impeccable service, the place itself?  they are all excellent and consistent, and simply do not disappoint but delight.  Again and again.
719;Our original plan was to opt for the £30 two course special. The final bill for the four of us was over £300!  Having said that we left absolutely delighted with our evening.  Immaculate food and service  and presentation that could not be faulted.  We will be back for sure.
720;Can't fault the service. The set menu is good value. Enjoy the ambiance.
721;Wilton's remains a little expensive but the food is consistently excellent. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and they happily rearranged a table for a down-sized group. An excellent venue for either business or personal entertaining. 8/10.
722;"I always used to tell people that the waiters at Wilton's were the best in London. They would stand quietly in the dining area and never approach you. You could attract their attention with the slighted glance and they would be helpful and informative to your questions. Dinner would be a delightfully private affair. Waiters didn't talk amongst themselves and miss your glance.Unfortunately, not any more.You sip from your glass and immediately a waiter comes over to refill your glass. If you tell them that you would rather pour your own  wine or water a diiferent waiter comes over to invade your privacy. There was one occasion where the waiter came over as I had the bottle in my hand and looked imploringly and in disbelieve as I continued to pour my own. An uncomfortable experience!Two other small errors in the experience. Everytime you give a menu order they say ""excellent choice"" and lastly the apple pie was accompanied by vanilla custard on the menu, it came with ice cream.Unlikely to go back. It has lost it's unique magic."
723;It was our first time at Wiltons.We booked the Restaurant while looking for a pre-theatre meal and Wiltons came recommended as a (mostly) Fish Restaurant. On arrival we were greeted and made to feel welcome. There's an old fashioned feel about the place which oozes service and quality. We were not disappointed.Taking the set menu we began with 6 Jersey Rock Oysters (me) and Brown Shrimps (my Wife) - good stuff! This was followed by Brill with Crabmeat - which was even better! The fish was cooked to perfection and complemented by Jersey New Potatoes. To finish I had Apple Crumble with Vanilla Ice cream,  again all was perfectly cooked. Accompanied by a bottle of Chablis (a bit pricey for a 2013  I thought, but the only thing I could find to grumble about) all in all it was an excellent meal and the next time we are in London, we'll certainly go again.
724;Wilton's is perfect or a special occasion. I took my parents for my Mum's birthday - the bellini with the Opentable deal was a splendid way to start. The food was outstanding and Mum thought the risotto was the best she had sampled - quite an accolade being a vegetarian! My leek and cheddar crumble was mouthwatering and passionfruit souffle had a delicious zing. The waiting staff were wonderfully courteous.
725;"The food was outstanding.  The cuisine is not modern but relies on ingredients of the highest quality .  Don't come if you are looking for the latest in complicated dishes with huge numbers of ingredients; do come if you are looking for the best.There were plenty of serving staff but there was the occasional lapse, with appropriate apologies.It is a very expensive restaurant but was worth the price for a special occasion.."
726;Wiltons is one of the classics - traditional atmosphere, superb service and lovely food.I've become a regular in recent years and can hardly fault it.Not cheap but then you get what you pay for.
727;We were treated like royalty from start to finish even though we were on the meal deal. They allowed us to share the starter and dessert, even serving it on separate plates. Wine was quite pricey but we found a lovely bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for £30. The cheese chariot was a sight to behold and waiters were very attentive. We will definitely be going back!
728;The offer on opentable made this restaurant affordable, though pricey I would be tempted to dine here again even without the offer. Most of the meals on the set menu were also on the main menu, which meant you were able to get a true reflection of the food normally served there. The cheese option was included in the set menu without any additional premium, and the selection of British cheeses was very good. The service was impeccable. This was British food served at its best in a charming environment. We had an enjoyable evening here and would definitely recommend it to others.
729;"A wonderful, well established restaurant; a great ambiance  with excellent food and service. A brilliant place for a birthday treat even better with the Open Table special offers. Will definately go again."
730;3 people, 2 courses each from spring set menu - mains & pudding. They charged us for the 2 courses set menu each plus £10 each for puddings, & of course the 12.5% service charge was for the overcharge as well. We learnt our lesson not to trust even the most established places. It was a very quiet Tuesday evening  no pressure on staff for mistakes, the carving trolley was off & we were offered beef instead of pork, this turned out to be steak, they didn't bother to tell us that when we ordered the beef from the spring menu. We over heard other regulars getting this info. The potatoes were lovely, the rest was just the rest. Nothing special.Overpriced even without the over charge.The Wolsley was way better food, service & value.Don't waste your money at the Wilton
731;We like Wilton`s very much, this was our second visit for lunch, loved the food, staff very good, butovervalued. Suggest the menu rather than the a la carte.
732;"I love the feeling I get when I walk into Wilton's – it is very formal , yet cozy, relaxed and the service is impeccable. The food is very high in standard  and I would take friends who are visiting as there is a very ""old English feel"" of the place which you don't get in most English restaurants in London. They have a great wine list and though the restaurant is pricey on the whole, it is great for a special occasion for sure!!"
733;Wilton's never disappoints. From the meet and greet to the moment one reluctantly retrieves one's coat,  the staff perform even the smallest tasks with supreme professionalism . The food may not be adventurous, but what they do, they do flawlessly , both in terms of taste and presentation. This restaurant is a joy to visit.. at least until the bill arrives!
734;Plush decor - yes of course they have tablecloths and no blackboards - and attentive and caring service, and simple faultless food and wonderful wine, in a calm respite from the world. Hoxton was never like this, and never will be. At a time when almost every restaurant is the same, Wiltons is now unique in London: a timeless classic.
735;We were made to feel very welcome and the food was very nice. However we felt that they didn't advise us very we'll on the portion sizes so we over ordered a little and the final bill was a little pricey.. Not sure it was worth £100 a head.
736;"and we heard ""I'll have what I always have"" and ""You'll no doubt have your usual?"" and the like several times. We are a ""mature"" couple but brought the average age down by, it felt, several decades. Very tightly packed tables - although not as tight as some more fashionable (and expensive) restaurants but we were disappointed that the carving trolley dish of the day was salmon. If you are booking for lunch you may want to check what will be on offer. Be warned, vegetables are not included in the set lunch although our choices did not require any additions. And some wines priced below £30  so not wallet-crushingly horrible but the chap next to us had a £300 claret with his Dover Sole which made me feel a bit of a cheapskate..."
737;The atmosphere was not relaxing at all and, from the beginning to the end, we didn't feel at ease ! Besides, the waiter didn't do his best to make us feel comfortable. We felt as if only wealthy people were welcome in this restaurant. For example, we chose simple soles but, pure coïncidence (?), there weren't left and we were compelled to order Dover soles that were far more expensive.We'll never come back in that tourist trap and we'll never advise anyone to go there !!!
738;No complaints about the food or the service but the prices are exaggerated. I have paid the same or less for better meals in restauarants in the Top 50 list, even in London. And the markup on the win must be above 4.
739;Our reservation was at 12.15. Efficiency and friendliness of the staff great as always. We were the first to be seated in the main room. The carvery was brought around - suckling pig with crackling. Fantastic, my favourite. I ordered this and was told the crackling had already finished (12.25 at this stage and just a few more guests in the restaurant- someone must have fallen asleep in the kitchen that morning!). Fortunately they were able to open a few bags of Pork Scratchings and put these on the side of my plate. While I'm not knocking the innovation, is this really an acceptable solution when this is one of the most expensive restaurants in London?  I'll forgive them because we all have amateur hours now and again.
740;A top notch restaurant. The service is unobtrusive but excellent, and the food is also excellent. On this occasion my guest thought his Dover sole was overdone. It wasn't tragic, but even so it was a little surprising that when the waiter was told (having asked how everything was) there was zero response. This rather irked my guest. Otherwise, I cannot fault the place.
741;Reliable if unexciting cooking. Service mostly good, sometimes a little inaccurate.
742;fantastic food, service and overall experiance. A real gem
743;On our second visit I was worried it wouldn't live up to the memories of our first... I'm pleased to say it surpassed them! Even on a set menu the food was incredible and service excellent. There was no different treatment because we didn't dine a la carte. The setting is beautiful and ambience buzzy. I'd definitely visit a third time!
744;"The service and ambience were impeccable. The oysters were a tad ""fishy"" and the house specialty carrot cake was terrible. The sole and halibut were excellent."
745;We came for lunch on the set lunch menu deal. Good food. Good service. A little disappointed they no longer had the carving table available at 1.15 given that there were just 3 main course choices on the set menu to begin with. But the replacement braised pig's cheeks were amazing. The mackeral salad was wonderful as was the rainbow trout with crushed potatoes. Would recommend.
746;Wilsons is in the same mold as Simpson's and Rules. Dark wood, plush seating with a substantial number of middle ages men having lunch on a rainy Monday. Food from the special menu was delicious and we were offered an excellent alternative to one course that was unavailable. We only had 2 courses as we were replete but also felt £8 for a pud was a tad expensive. Would definitely return
747;The service was great and all the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. However we were not informed about the set menu only being available until a certain time, and we were told the carving trolley was not available, despite seeing it 5min before we ordered. The appetizers were good (oysters and steak tartar) However the mains were bland and massively overpriced £7 for carrots? really?.  No music plays in the restaurant which makes for a very oppressive atmosphere. £100 a head is not reasonable unless the food is amazing. The food is definitely not amazing. 2/10 for excellent coat checking simulator.
748;To help celebrate any occasion to be enjoyed in a relaxing atmosphere and would certainly have no hesitation in returning again to the restaurant.
749;I simply cannot fault Wilton’s, and my wife and I have been going there for many years, and it has never lost its edge or the quality dipped.  Everything is impeccable and also not pretentious.  Fantastic service (especially from the sommelier and the person serving from the roast trolley), and really, really good food.  A delight!
750;Traditional British restaurant with exceptional service, an extensive wine list and a pleasant ambience. The food successfully hits its mark as traditional British fare, with good quality ingredients and presentation. Perfect for a business lunch or family dinner.
751;We had the fixed price menu ( 2 courses £30/3 courses £38 incl glass of champagne ) Outstanding service and ambience . 3 choices per course and decent size portions. I did not love my fish dish , but it was well cooked, just didn't love it . Lovely people , lovely setting . I would recommend most definitely .
752;This is a place for people who like comfort, cossetting, and excellent food.  There is NO music!  Just mainly caring staff, a kitchen that knows about preparing food, and a good wine list.  This is a place to go when you want to spend time talking and enjoying, at the same time, good food.  It starts with excellent bread.  The menu is mainly fish.  We started with a plate of crab served with excellent mayonnaise and sprats perfectly fried and again served with excellent tartar sauce.  Then we had lemon sole and the special of the day which was baked halibut in pastry with mushrooms and rice.  Both perfectly cooked.  We had spinach, creamed celeriac, a fried potatoes.  The potatoes were the only disappointment--tasted and looked like frozen potatoes.  Cannot wait to go back!
753;I took a friend to Wiltons, who had not been in ages. The decor and atmosphere are timeless in the old English style. The tables are quite close to each other but not too crowded. The staff was really nice and attentive. We had a delicious dinner. My scallops were perfect but a bit on the tiny side. My main of Cheddar and leek crumble was incredible, as was my friend's Hake. And we had one of the best bread and butter pudding. Wine list is ok if you can spend a lot, not as good for more reasonable wines. Overall great experience but the bill was a bit much.
754;I have been to Wiltons now and then during a long time. Never been disappointed.Wiltons belongs to those restaurants that do not try to be a bit Italian or bit French.Wiltons is profoundly British and gives British food at its best!
755;I had never heard of Wiltons and was a little hesitant. However the food and service were fantastic, I will definitely be returning. They also do quite a few decent wines by the glass, which is great for those of us that like to mix and match with courses.
756;The food was out of this world, the wine list exemplary and the service was second to none.
757;A warm welcome heralded an evening that turned out to be something special. An interesting setting with a seasonal menu supported by a wide selection of superb wine was complimented by the quality of the produce, superb cooking and a friendly, attentive service. Our first visit, and hopefully not our last.
758;food not up to usual standard, service excellent as always. very disappointed that a diner was able to bring her dog into the restaurant. it sat on a bench seat and ate food off the table cloth!
759;Excellent food and service. A dinner thoroughly enjoyed by my wife and I. Well recommended. Will need to leave a little more space for the desert next time...
760;Love the atmosphere of a traditional London club,  service first class, menu varied,the plaice and sole were excellent, the roast of the day, lamb, was devoured with relish. Wine was reasonably priced and the sommelier very helpful. We have already decided to return and try other dishes from this very English restaurant.
761;Booked a 7:30 table for two to celebrate a birthday. We ate In one of the cute booths and were offered champagne immediately upon sitting. The staff was very helpful in guiding us through the menu and the sommelier made a truly wonderful wine recommendation. We never felt rushed, they seemed to only do one seating per night, which was nice. The cooked oysters were really amazing, even for someone from the U.S. Gulf Coast. A great, special meal! We had a dozen oysters, cheese soufflé, lobster bisque, Dover sole and the black currant soufflé for dessert with fresh mint tea. All excellent!
762;Just as a restaurant should be, quality food,Great staff, polite and attentive at all times.Well recommended.Would visit again whenever in london.
763;Me and my husband had a lovely evening at Wiltons.Good service and good food.
764;A little old school but exceptionally good food and excellent service. This is restaurant with atmosphere and gravitas. Expensive but worth it.
765;Wiltons has been open since the nineteenth century, and while I cannot vouch for their performance then, the food they serve now is a fine way to argue that Britons didn't learn how to eat yesterday. Simple dishes like kidneys and black pudding, but also more showpieces like Beef Wellington, are elaborately presented and taste good too. The set menu is more reasonably priced and not too boring, the oysters fresh, and the Christmas pudding is dissolved in brandy butter and syrup before one's eyes. The staff seems in a good mood, so the diner is also able to enjoy these flourishes. Not for every evening, but not just for a special evening either.
766;First time there and enjoyed the buzz the food probably not the cost but we got what we paid for so no grumbles
767;I've been to Wiltons before and I just love the ambiance and the great staff. The oysters are the best in London and we also had some breathtaking desserts but the main course was unfortunately not worth the price. We ate seabass and halibut and it was good but nothing more or less.
768;Great corner table away from the to-ing and fro-ing you get at some tables in any restaurant.  Had the set lunch - smoked salmon, beef, coffee and petit-fours and it was good.  Will be back!  Older crowd perhaps but nothing wrong with that when you are a pensioner.
769;Once again, a great dinner at Wilton's. Everything was perfect and the service was impeccable.
770;What a marvellous experience.  From the minute we walked through the door we were made to feel special.  Our food order was taken before we were presented with the wine list so we could make an informed choice.  The service was excellent and the food delicious.
771;Wiltons is by far my favourite restaurant. From the friendly welcome to the outstanding food and impeccable ambiance and service my guests and I have always been delighted with Wiltons. After being a devotee for more than twenty years, Wiltons is firmly established in my very short list of outstanding restaurants.
772;excellent service and food, great surroundings, almost faultless
773;Wiltons is a lovely, if very expensive, restaurant and I've always enjoyed going there for special occasions. The fish dishes do not disappoint: my grilled Dover sole was perfect. But other dishes (especially the veg) were overly salted - to the point of being nearly inedible. The service was a bit rushed. At these prices, a stately pace is called for and one shouldn't feel they are trying to turn over the table! The bill was staggering (£280 for 2 people) and so they need to get everything right.
774;The food is basic but perfectly cooked.  The service is courteous.  The ambiance is satisfactorily old-fashioned.  It's not cheap, but I've paid much more for much less good.
775;Very good meal indeed. Classic British cooking - lots of favourite's on the menu.
776;Well, after a slightly disappointing narrow loss to the Kiwis at Twickenham I cannot think of a more relaxing way to spend the evening. And to show off to my German friend and son that the British kitchen is not 'awful' as many Europeans like to scoff.The food, atmosphere, gin and tonic and service was outstanding. A big thank you to all the staff at Wiltons and Marco for his oyster dialogue. Highly recommended.
777;One of those special restaurants which has great style and great food.  Sea food specialists but also with perfectly cooked meat.  I had dozen oysters followed by lamb cutlets, which were both perfect.  Fruit salad was presented beautifully.  The wine list has some very nice selections but watch out for the prices, I preferred a glass of different types with the starter and main course. I will visit again.
778;We were really impressed, having not been there for fifteen years, how well Wilton's preserves traditional values.  It was truly a treat to return.  Dover Sole @ £48 a hit was a bit of a stopper but the quality of it was excellent.  I doubt anywhere in the world does it better.
779;traditional decor, delicious food, attentive (but not intrusive) service. highly recommend this classic venue for a special night out in london.
780;The luncheon at Wiltons that my wife and me hosted for our oldest son and his wife was nothing less than a stairway to heaven - an experience of transcendent immanens. Each dish exalted us higher still and higher over the realms of every day life towards the gates of a culinaric Paradise. An elegantly served truffle finally brought us all over the treshhole.
781;Lunch at Wiltons was excellent imecable service great food and friendley environment, we will be back
782;Beautiful restaurant, excellent service and wonderful food (very fresh fish and seafood). Will most definitely return.
783;I fell in love with the Wiltons. Excellent service and first-class food. As I'm new to oysters waiter helped me to choose a selection with a class of champagne - found out my favorites quite quickly. My lamb was perfectly cooked  - mint sauce was so fresh and delicious - and mash was better than in any restaurant I have ever been - smooth and silky with truffle slices on top! Bread and butter budding was nicely moist and the custard was lovely with the pudding. At least to me this is the BEST restaurant I have ever been!
784;We all know it's expensive but when you enter the restaurant you know you are there for a treat and that every pound spent there will be worth its value.
785;This was a special birthday meal. The staff were so polite to everyone - all the tables were treated so well. Food was brilliant, wine list good and varied. A really nice experience all round. Nothing to complain about at all!
786;Superb food served by knowledgeable and friendly staff. Will definitely return next time I'm in London.
787;Food great,  service ok, sommelier poor, wine corked and and bill overcharged.If you're a regular great-otherwise go elsewhere .
788;I went to Wiltons to celebrate my 4 year anniversary with my partner. I was looking for a special place with a unique atmosphere and excellent food and that s exactly what I found in Wiltons. The service was outstanding! The very knowledgeable waiters looked after us from the minute we walked in till we left. The food was absolutely delicious. We chose from the a la carte menu and had scallops and see food salad as starters and roast beef and venison as mains. The meat was perfectly cooked and was accompanied by the most exquisite gravy.We went for a light red wine (vosne romanee) which was truly one of the best wines I've ever tasted. We ended the meal with desert, accompanying wine, and a coffee. Overall it was fantastic. 10 out of 10.
789;excellent food and service. friendly and very correct staff.
790;Wonderful celebration lunch - fantastic food, service and setting. Thank you
791;The food and the service is outstanding. The restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere of typical English culture.It is a joy to come to the Wiltons.
792;"My favorite restaurant in London if not the world.  Superb ingredients, prepared in an utterly traditional, but not at all stodgy, manner.  I had the dressed crab and the sole (one night meuniere, the next night--yes I went back--the goujons).  Service is dignified but warm. I usually describe to my friends back in America as ""like having dinner at your favorite aunt's house, if she happens to be the Duchess of Devonshire."""
793;Excellent food, great ambiance, superb service, impossible to leave any food behind, amazing cheese tray, and quite visible a place for the powers that be in British politics.
794;Exceptional food, service and ambience, (classy), a little bit pricey, but you know, it's Wiltons...
795;Old fashioned classics.  Had the sole, was delicious.  Don't go expecting light modern European - think rich and decadent and you'll be pleased.Its in Mayfair and is priced accordingly but I think good value never-the-less.
796;Wilton's is one of my husband's favourite dining places and for his 75th birthday, we decided it was time to introduce our grown up children to the establishment.  We had a wonderful family celebration, service was impeccable and the food and wine, excellent.
797;Our first visit to Wiltons but certainly not our last. On arrival the ambience was just perfect and immediately the staff were so attentive but not overly so. I had an excellent twice baked cheese souffle to start and my wife had oysters whichever wonderful. We both had the most perfect beef Wellington for main course with lovely dauphinoise potatoes. I had cheese for dessert and Ann had an excellent bread and butter pudding. The wine waiter was very caring and the staff altogether were as good as we have had anywhere.
798;Staff were unfailingly welcoming, polite and helpful. Service attentive but not intrusive. Food, presentation and quality of cooking were faultless.
799;My wife and I were looking forward to our dinner at Wiltons. The last time we were there it was a wonderful experience so our expectations were high. This time everything was so perfect that it actually exceeded our very high expectations. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. Service wasw delightful. The food was impeccable. Wiltons seems to have a lock on the preparartion of Dover Sole. Wine by the glass options were exceptional.  All in all it was a very memorable evening.Now, the next time we return the bar will be set even higher.
800;Pricey for what it is. But the service is first rate. It depends what you order of course.
801;We love going to Wilton's as it is like a time travel machine.  Sorry they have had to relax the dress code to modern times like so many places though.  Really gentlemen, can't you put on a coat and tie for dinner?  Charming wait staff made for a pleasurable evening.  This is not a place to economize.  Go for it!  Great English fare and superior wine list in a charming environment.  We even indulged in a pair of Wilton's cuff links! Great Dover Sole.  Finished with the blackberry soufflé .
802;Wilton's provides the most attentive, non-intrusive service we have ever experienced.  The ambiance is cozy and elegant,  The food amazing.  But the price reflects all of these superlatives.  Worth it, in our estimation.
803;We visit Wilton's each time we get to London and it never fails us.  Every menu item we choose is nothing less than perfect and the service is impeccable.  What a pleasure!
804;Outstanding food and outstanding service. Unique athmosphere and brilliant old fashioned service.  Would be difficult to find anything better.
805;Lovely place to go to. Such friendly staff and service was outstanding, can't wait to go again
806;A group of us come to Wilton's each year to commemorate a friend who died several years ago--a special occasion worthy of the special food and special service that we know we can expect from Wilton's.
807;Highly recommend, great and reliable service. A go to for any occassion
808;This restaurant is a must stop whenever I am in London.
809;Fabulous seafood (especially shellfish and smoked salmon) and outstanding service.  Very British in every respect.  There is nothing like Wiltons in America.
810;"Everything about Wilton's was superb.  The service was impeccable and unusually considerate of my octogenarian table-mate; the culinary selections, whether table d'hote or a la carte were marvelous, and the wine list was extensive.  The ambiance was at once stately and understated. I had expected as much from the reputation of Wilton's, but I was very pleased to find that the restaurant lived up entirely to those expectations."
811;Used the toptable (which they also have at the restaurant as part of normal menu) set menu, £30 for two courses (£38 for three if you want it), plus glass of prosecco. Excellent quality food presented in very nice manner. Slightly stuffy atmosphere which was fine after the first few minutes. Proper 'English' environment. Overall a very nice dining experience. Wine VERY expensive!
812;Excellent food and service in a super environment.
813;Feels like I have stepped into a different era - lobster is huge and service impeccable! Definitely will come back again on another special occasion.
814;"Was it good .. was it bad? I am not sure. Maybe I should start by saying we ordered from the fixed price menu: 3 courses for 38 pounds. Do I expect ""the best"" for that money? Probably not .. but I do expect a good price/value ratio. Had 6 oysters for starter so that was a plus .. and the john dory fish was also really nice but with ordering only 1 glass of wine (for one person) ended up paying 125 pounds which still made it look more expensive than it should have been. It is an old restaurant and maybe in the weekend a bit more quiet. Gentlemen who served us was kind enough so overall verdict .. nice to try but wouldn't necessarily come back. The carving looked really delicious though (not included as an option in the set menu though)."
815;"You will find no restaurant in the world that has more respect for the tradition of gracious dining. Few restaurants deserve the word ""perfect"", but it definitely applies to Wilton's food, service and ambiance. Bravo!"
816;Our first visit- and definitely not our last ! On the menu was a selection of Dorset,  Colchester and Jersey oysters: although there is not a r in the month they were the best I have ever tasted. Service was very good and we were made to feel very welcome.
817;I took my girlfriend for a special birthday and was not disappointed.  The initial formality melted away with impeccable service, attentive but discrete staff, exceptional food and very pleasant surroundings.
818;One of the great classics - so reliable.The choice on the lunch menu is quite limited but good value for such an up market establishment.
819;Astonishingly expensive, but astonishingly brilliant, food, service and wine were outstanding. It's a treat , but one I'm intending to repeat. It's reassuring to know that somewhere so traditional remains untouched by the modern world. It could have been 1972, or 1872, it is a world class venue. Do not expect foaming frogs legs or apples disguised as meat pies, no moronic celebrity chefs to fawn over, just premier league waiting staff and chefs who appear when needed, offer advice and help if required, but allow you to enjoy the company your in, I was with friends who I'd not seen for 2 years, lunch was about us, not to gawk at a chef. But this venue gives everything to allow that to happen. I loved it. So will you .
820;What a delight- blown away- charming in every area
821;We were there to celebrate my partner's birthday and went for lunch, choosing the set menu.  We love a restaurant with something a bit different, such as a historic building or a history to the restaurant itself , so Wiltons seemed to fit the bill.The greeting staff took us straight to our table and were very welcoming. Service was carried out with immaculate timing, but without being intrusive or overbearing and all made us feel comfortable.  We both had roast beef which was perfect and the accompaniments were all well cooked and very hot.The only criticism is that the wine is on the pricey side.Otherwise everything on the set menu is extremely good quality and value for money and service is excellent.A real British classic.
822;Wilton's was the perfect place for a leisurely lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The food was classic and beautifully cooked.  Service excellent.  Slightly disappointed with the wine - we chose a chablis and it wasn't the best example of it's kind for the price bracket.  I would return nevertheless.
823;We loved this restaurant and will be back! Traditional but not stuffy, it has a certain elegance, much nicer than newer, 'trendy' restaurants. Lovely bar and restaurant area, excellent service, DELICIOUS food.... really gorgeous. Highly recommended!
824;One could not ask for a more pleasant evening than dinner at Wilton's. If there's a nitpick, it's the uniforms worn by some of the ladies who serve. The uniforms remind us of those worn by nurses in a hospital. Perhaps they could find a more uplifting color combination. Each time the lady came to serve us, we had an expectation of a medical procedure.  That is an observation, not a criticism. Even so, Wilton's is eminently worthy. Don't miss it.
825;I've come here many times over the years and it is always wonderful.An institution that manages to stay fresh and new and still stay the same.The service is amazingly friendly and charming. What a special place!
826;This is undiluted, traditional pleasure. Everything top notch and service discreet.
827;What makes this place exceptional  is the service.  Top notch with food to match.
828;We had three courses and enjoyed them all. My only comment on the the food was a slightly cold inside to the Bread and Butter pudding dessert, which was unfortunate given the rest of the meal. The ambiance was somewhat subdued although I would recommend this restaurant again.
829;My husband and I dined at Wiltons for the first time last weekend. We chose it because of the favourable reviews and were not disappointed. The moment we entered we knew we were in for a memorable evening. The ambience was intimate , even though there were groups of 8+ . The staff were attentive without being over bearing, and the food was outstanding. The carvery of the day-Beef Wellington melted in the mouth, and my dessert-chocolate fondant with honeycomb and ginger ice cream was the best I have ever eaten. We would recommend Wiltons without reservation, and will definitely be returning customers!
830;Looking for something traditionally British this is one choice. The decor and service are mid-century throw backs. Food was plentiful and prepared well. Service was timely and friendly without being in your business. I still can't figure out how they knew it was my birthday. They presented a birthday greeting dessert plate to my sister so someone must have overheard us but weren't sure which of is was celebrating. It was a sweet touch. 
831;We made a late notice booking for a Saturday evening table for 2 at the Wiltons.  Despite booking over the internet only 30 minutes before arrival, we were made to feel as if we were old regulars.  The menu was extensive and we found no difficulty with choice, in fact our only challenge was we both wanted to try most dishes.  I opted for the Beef Wellington special of the day, my partner Steak.  Both dishes, in fact all 3 courses, the wine and champagne and brandy were delicious.  I have been lucky to have eaten in many of the worlds very best restaurants , without a shadow of doubt Wiltons goes straight into the top 10.  Absolutely amazing food and service.  Thank you so much, looking forward to a return in the very near future!!!
832;The food is amazing and the staff were very attentive.  It felt a little like an old boys club, so maybe not suitable for a romantic dinner. But great for a business lunch.
833;Whenever I go to Wiltons, whether alone, with my wife or with a party, the food and service are always top class.  The relaxed, friendly and professional service clearly result from a long tradition of providing good food at a good venue.
834;Great food and outstanding service in comfortable setting.
835;A wonderful meal. We really enjoyed every aspect of Wilton. It will become a favourite for business lunches and date night. 
836;This was our first visit to Wiltons and we weren't disappointed. The service was good (even though we started off with the wrong menu!) and the food was very tasty. We had the set menu which gave a good choice and both of the mains - lemon sole and steak were cooked perfectly. A good location and nice restaurant. The only issue was that everyone was put at tables at the back of restaurant - not sure why???
837;"The whole experience is unique, very olde worlde charm, the service is impeccable. We've made an error of judgement and ordered off the set menu, so £38 pp turned into £95 pp. Seafood dishes were superb in quality and even in quantity. However, the sirloin steak was a little on the dry side, albeit cooked to spec and malleable.  Desserts were sensational. Cheese plate was ample and varied, chocolate, caramel and peanut crunch thing stunned us both. In terms of lessons learnt - stick to the seafood and fish dishes, don't stray from the set menu and beware the wine list! Oh, and if the charming waiter suggests you ""try the gull egg, it goes very well with your cocktail"", it's not gratis. These babies are £8 each."
838;I wasn't sure Wiltons would be my style but I was totally wrong. The seating is fantastic with plenty of space between tables making conversation easy. The staff were exceptional and the food / wine, delicious. It was also amazingly good value with the set menu. Will definitely go again
839;The staff were friendly and helpful. We had the Seasonal Menu which was well-cooked, attractively presented and good value. Although we only had tap water to drink, the staff ensured our glasses were kept full. A very satisfactory experience.
840;I have eaten at Wiltons numerous times over the years, even though I live in the US.It you want great food and service don't miss the opportunity .
841;This was our second visit to Wilton. I chose the restaurant specially after a very enjoyable first visit over a year ago. The welcome to Wilton's is friendly and efficient.Ambience for a non English person is everything you expect from an old well established London restaurant.My oysters as a starter were delicious and I was happy I chose them again on my second visit.  The food was truly enjoyable although to our disappointment the carvery trolley had been popular and the meat from it had run out. The deserts were fantastic and for some reason surprised us all.  Next time might just go and eat the desert menu from beginning to the end. Please go and enjoy a truly English restaurant.
842;"I went there with my friend from Canada since he wanted to try some British cuisine.  The staffs in Wiltons were extremely welcoming and professional. The food were AMAZING! Highly recommend the oyster selection, which were truly fresh; and the broccoli soup, the plating was so delicate. Seasonal menus are worth trying out. Overall, very memorable dining experience."
843;We had the OpenTable menu, which was good except that the trout was way overcooked and totally dry. Interesting, historic atmosphere of old fashioned service from years gone made up for it.
844;Atmosphere like an English club--very traditional food, service, menu. We liked it very much.
845;Great service...great institution, but getting a bit expensive.
846;I booked here for my wife's birthday, and requested a quiet romantic table. On arrival we were led to a lovely booth in the corner, which was perfect, as some of the tables in were quite close to each other. We had the toptable set menu, and it had enough choic for us, both the salad and the smoked salmon were excellent, and we both went for the sole as our main course. My wife does not eat mussels, and they made sure one came with, and one without. Sauce was superb, and really made this dish, and the accompanying carrots were cooked to perfection. We shared a crumble for dessert, and it was good, though the charges of 2.50 for a small scoop of icecream seemed a little cheeky. Would certainly go again, as service was excellent throughout.
847;Very attentive staff but the waitresses looked more like nurses.  There should be a style overhaul of their uniforms.The oysters were excellent but the cost of our main course was excessive, £45 for a small piece of Halibut and in excess of £30 for the Sole.  There did seem to be a lot of salt used in all dishes.  However, the vegetable we're cooked perfectly, particularly the asparagus, with just the right amount of crispness.Overall I would not visit this restaurant again as I think that there are far better restaurants in London charging half the price.
848;very classic venue with traditional yet elegant interior decor, the staff are very polite and attentive, everyone greet us along the way from the entrance to our table, the pre-theater menu is great value for first time visit, food portion is decent and taste great, will definitely recommend and visit again.  
849;"We return to Wilton""s every time we are in London.  The food is absolutely superb, and the service is every bit as good as the food, if not even better.  You cannot find a better place for dinner."
850;Classy outfit.
851;Always the best for oyster and caviar
852;Wiltons has been arround for ever and everytime I visit I am delighted with the experience. It is what I call a banker it never lets you down old fashioned good food, excellent service and a great evening. 
853;We had a wonderful evening. The staff were attentive without being all over you. They were charming and the food was fantastic. They accommodated my diary intolerance friend without fuss or bother.I would highly recommend this venue
854;We went for dinner for an anniversary and the restaurant had a lovely ambience and atmosphere. The staff were great - attentive and friendly. The place had a wonderful old world charm and the price was reasonable with the set menu. I would say that my plaice was a little on the oily side with the butter sauce being a little overwhelming and the pork roast was nice but maybe lacking a few vegetables on the side. Entrees and dessert were lovely and I would definitely go back for special occasions.
855;The whole place was fantastic the moment we walked in. The service was very attentive and we had the best fresh oysters we ever had. Could not fault the place.
856;I went with a mentor to Wiltons and had some turbot which was deliciously meaty.
857;Lovely special birthday dinner thanks to Wiltons. I treated my Partner but he wanted to show me haute British cuisine (I'm American and typically grumble about classic fare). I couldn't have been more wrong. Lovely food (dover sole), top level service and relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommend for special evenings.
858;Excellant service & excellant foodGood comprehensive menu provided in wonderful surroundings, will defiently return.Ideal for special occassions or just a personal indulgence.
859;Took a colleague for lunch. Lovely ambience with great and unobtrusive service. Had the special offer menu - the sole veronique was particularly delicious. Will certainly go again.
860;The service and attention to detail was good. The oysters were one of the best I've had. The table felt slightly isolated but I guess you can't have everthing. Yes will definitely recommend and visit again.
861;Had a lovely meal here on Saturday night. From the moment you arrive to the time you leave you are looked after extremely well. The service, cleanliness and food were all top notch. Highly recommended.
862;I chose Wiltons to belatedly celebrate my birthday during our weekend trip to London, and was not disappointed in any aspect of the evening. The combination of great ambience, food and service contributed to the best fine dining experience we have had for a long time. The scallop appetiser was delicious (I had to restrain myself from licking the dish)! The lobster was also amazing. No room for dessert. My husband had the set menu and enjoyed it thoroughly, although he didn't choose the seafood option. His cheese board included two lovely cheeses, and the staff kindly provided us with the names and where we could possibly buy them. We thoroughly recommend Wiltons for the high quality of service (not intrusive and well-timed) and divine food!
863;We arrived and despite having thought I'd booked a special deal, they provided us with two bellinis anyway. The service was impeccable, amusing but discreet. The food was excellent, especially the vegetables. The ambience meant that you could hear each other talk, which is a pleasant change. All in all a great night - perfect restaurant for a special occasion.Thank you
864;As always Wiltons provided superb food and service.
865;Great service. Very classic ambience.
866;we could receive fine foods and splendid hospitality at wiltons. So I fully recommend to business occasion and special purpose, in Japanese perspective. Because this restaurant is very traditional and not noisy, and there is proper space from next table.
867;Ambiance and dinner is good but price is a little high
868;A Jermyn Street stalwart but let's not forget how welcome it is to have good service, a restrained atmosphere, comfortable surrounds and a quality experience where you feel looked after. A welcome break from all that goes on outside. The perfect place for the right occasion.
869;We found the tables to be too close together. As a result my wife and I were subjected to unwanted business conversations on either side of our table.
870;Specialising in fish but the meat is excellent too. Quality food with top quality service. Not the cheapest but worth every penny for a special occasion (my wife's birthday this time). Would def recommend and would def go back.
871;Wiltons though expensive, may be the best dining that I have had. I'll be going back on my next visit to London.
872;The food tasted good, but the portions were TINY and WAY over priced. The dover sole still had bones left in it. Lobster for £55 was like the size of a starter. Will never go again.
873;An excellent lunch at this classic restaurant. The food was absolutely superb and without fault.
874;Highly recommmend this restaurant well known for its fish and game. The venison melted in my mouth. Excellent service, delicious wines ...what more could one ask for? Well, one thing, perhaps....i understand there doesnt need to be a formal dress code, but if you arrive in a suit and tie, out of respct and consideration for your fellow diners, it would be preferable if you maintain some decorum and don't roll up your shirtsleeves at dinner.
875;We had a good dinner with good service and food. The restaurant has a lovely decoration , the staff is nice and friendly. It is a good address for London.
876;Booked for my husbands 50th birthday. Really enjoyed it - smoked eel starter was sublime!! Really a treat. Advice on which wine to have was spot on. Service lovely & attentive. Not too much, not too little - just right.
877;Spent a very pleasant evening on 15 February for my husbands birthday. Food was excellent and service and attention to detail was fantastic. Real old world charm, would not hesitate to recommend.
878;We had a fantastic meal - The food was amazing. The staff knowledgable, polite and attentative (bordering on overly attentative). Very cosy setting with tables close together, so if you want a private conversation...It's probably not possible in the main area.
879;Excellence in every department, with a price tag to match.
880;Classy old style restaurant, serving traditional seafood . Good salmon and oysters selection. Trolley service also nice touch
881;I went here for a wedding anniversary dinner recently. It is a wonderful restaurant, full of character and history. The service is exceptional: attentive without being intrusive. The menu is fantastic for traditional British food: game (I had woodcock), fish, old classics such as prawn cocktail, smoked eel, lamb kidneys and bacon, omlets. Portion sizes are spot on and there is a good wine list. Will be returning.
882;Superb food in wonderful surroundings - a gem.Like Schwatzenegger, I will return.
883;My husband and I visiting from the United States on our honeymoon, and spent our first night in London enjoying dinner at Wilton's. Their food is unparalleled in our experience. The restaurant itself is lovely, warm and has great atmosphere. The staff were incredibly welcoming and professional. The food was a total knockout. My husband and I are certain that we will return to Wilton's as often as we can.
884;We celebrated my husbands birthday with lunch at Wilton's and had the most wonderful time at this iconic establishment. The food was traditional English at its best - perfectly cooked game, delicious oysters, feather-light Stilton soufflé - and the service was excellent. Although this was our first visit to Wilton's we felt like regulars being welcomed back. The atmosphere is a little like a gentlemens club - convivial and cosy. We can't wait to return to this st James institution - it's the perfect place for a special occasion meal.
885;First vist. Best meal of the week. Oozes quality. Food very good. Staff tremendous. Nice to eat somewhere not sat next somebody who deems crumpled tee shirt first choice in the restaurant wardrobe department.Long live Wilton's.
886;Reviews had given the impression of a place stuck in a time warp. But no. While it retains the good aspects of tradition -comfort and good (but not obsequious) service - Wilton's has moved into the 21st century. While traditionalists can still find the dishes they favour, we enjoyed a rather more modern take. We did have their traditional speciality - oysters (delicious) - but also a very tasty cod dish brought to life by a mustard sabayon and - best of all - the desserts. For me, a creamy, light crème caramel with raisins and a Sauternes jelly. Delicious! Even the coffee was excellent. While the set menu we had cost more than the average, it was well worth paying for the high quality. The waitress hoped we'd return - it's a certainty!
887;From arrival we were taken care of and thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. Each team member plays an integral part to ensure that the visit is enjoyed.
888;Wiltons is for those who appreciate fine food, beautifully served. The menu is extensive, and all ingredients are of the best. The food is simply cooked, but too perfection. Fish and shell fish are a speciality, and but meat and game and vegetarian are equally well treated. The wine list is to the same high standard.The service matches the food: highly civilized, yet not impersonal. All of this of course is not cheap, but it is a great treat.
889;An excellent restaurant well located with attentive and professional staff. Our party consisted of 3 people and was the first time we had visited the restaurant. We would certainly return on the basis of this visit. We had the set priced meal which offered excellent value with a good selection of choice . The food and service was excellent and the ambiance was particularly good. Although the restaurant was particularly busy on the night we visited the staff coped very well and we were still made to feel valued.This is a traditional restaurant with high standards. Well suited for business and social purposes.
890;It gives the aura of something special and indeed the staff on arrival gave the feeling the night was going to be very special. This was not to be a long wait cold soup and expensive mediocre food was the final result. We spent over 10 minutes watching our food on a holding table only to be told that it need to be reprepared and it would take a little while longer! The soup that was then served was as cold as my Oysters they were good (credit were credit is due) the only thing that arrived quickly was the drinks (water was replenished as soon as a glass was put down) and the check!
891;Excellent rock oysters and roast lamb from the trolley but this only came with roast potatoes. These were very good but a green vegetable was extra.
892;Great ambient and great food. Outstanding service that made together with the food and the ambient, the dinner experience an un-forgotable one.Will come back as soon as I'm in London again.
893;Fish excellent but overall expensive -a three course meal in a two Michelin starred restaurant would have been less expensive than our two course dinner
894;"True British dining; not too fussy, offering old style ambiance and service with a classic menu. It does not fall into the 'Michelin trap' of 'trying too hard'. Everything is 'just so'! Ambiance is formal yet relaxed. Service friendly but professional. Food prepared and presented just as it should be. You pay, but overall offering is good value. Wine List is overpriced; selection very good, but value is questionable. This is typical of many upmarket restaurants right now. Do try Wiltons. Locals will experience nostalgia, especially if they make it as far as the savouries. Overseas visitors will love it for its 'Britishness' and quality. If wine prices make your eyes water, don't worry; the cheapest are all good, so choose shamelessly !"
895;Wiltons has been around for ages. For a reason. It is bloody good. We had a wonderful lunch with the freshest of oysters, a Lovely game and foie gras pie and a perfect sticky toffee pudding. With two glasses of champagne and a bottle of sparkling water. Bill: 60 GBP for two. How could anybody say nought else but: jolly good show. Keep on doing it!
896;Some people seem to think the service can be a bit much but we thought it was brilliant. Food was beautifully done and delicious. Wine, while pricey, was also excellent. I don't like to go back to too many restaurants as there are so many to try in London but this may be an exception.
897;extraordinary highly recommend for oyster and Trolley
898;This is such a brilliant example of Britishness. Although ties are no longer required Wiltons is still very posh and the service is just as it should be, outstanding. We had a lovely meal with excellent Wine and there was no hesitation to change our meal when we decided to change our mind.
899;The restaurant has the feel of history-- a lovely feeling in the current speeded and noisy restaurant scene. We had Dover Sole and must say that it was not up to J Sheekey--but who could be?
900;Wilton's is a London classic but that does not mean it is always brilliant. The food can at times fail to live up to expectations and standards and the service, especially when it comes to topping up your water and wine glasses, can be a little over enthusiastic and annoying. Yet for all this it remains one of a kind in the London restaurant scene.
901;I hadn't realised there was a no open toe rule so luckily I was wearing boots. What a lovely experience, we had a great time.
902;Great service, very attentive, just how it should be. Food choice very good and cooked to perfection. My only critique would be the price of the sweets, all priced at £10 each for simple recepes!
903;Great food and service. Quality was excellent.
904;Wilton's gets all the basics right. The room is rather formal yet cozy, while the staff is attentive without being intrusive. This was my third visit and the food has been terrific each time.
905;Lobter thermidor is superb and a must try.
906;Chose Wiltons for the final dinner after a long tour of Europe. There were four tired travelers and we were treated like royals in every way. Loved the Dover Sole. We felt the price was supported by the wonderful service, food, and ambiance.
907;My wife and I had a wonderful dinner at Wilton's. Beautiful interior with smaller rooms for an intimate atmosphere. The wait staff were attentive, knowledgable and engaging, which made the meal enjoyable, and the food certainly lived up to our expectations. My wife had the carving tray of the day and I had the lamp cutlets. Both were outstanding. The sides, green beans and roasted potatoes, we're perfectly done. The Blackberry Soufflé with Cinnamon Ice Cream was outstanding. As a note, regardless of the dress noted on their web site, most men were in ties. I was glad we were dressed for the evening, and the restaurant was full mid-week with many, well-dressed locals. Always a good sign for your choice of restaurant.
908;"On Jermyn Street, well-known for traditional English shirt-makers, this restaurant is as traditional as it gets. Be transported a few centuires back. The food is very good though. I wouldn't go ""private"", but it's perfect for a business lunch if you want a quiet place where you can actually hear what your guest is saying to you."
909;Excellent food, great atmosphere,super service, can't fault them.
910;"I took my wife & father-in-law the other night. Leaving Wiltons with a hefty bill in my hand, my wife whispered, ""How much was that?"". Well, we'd had three courses - drinks to start, a bottle of wine, etc. - and it had come to just under £300. ""Wow,"" came the answer. But it didn't need much defending. We could have spent half of that at an ok restaurant. We could have spent £100 just going to Pizza Express. But the food we had at Wiltons was so staggeringly awesome, so understatedly & professionally presented, it was not only a far superior experience, but a thousand times better value. The bisque was the best I've ever had, the venison the best I've ever had, and the chocolate fondant too. The mango sorbet was simply sublime."
911;This is the classic venue for British food at its very best. Service is outstanding and each course presented superbly. The seafood and game, the latter now in season, are quite delicious. Highly recommended restaurant for the discerning food lover.
912;Simply amazing. Will go back very soon.
913;Walking into Wiltons was like stepping back in time - in a good, don't change a thing sort of way. Faultless service. We had the £32 set menu which offered a couple of choices and a glass of bubbly. The smoked venison was perfect and the pigs cheek sublime and dauphinoise so unashamedly naughty I had to eat it all! A perfect soufflé flowed by dainty petit fours rounded off one of the best meals I have had for a while. Of course with an eyewateringly pricey wine list the final bill was a far cry from £32 but by the time the bill came we didn't care. Good stuff Wiltons. We will be back.
914;"Wilton's is for us ""going home"" in London. The experience of dining there is unsurpassed. I would not change a thing."
915;Excellent service by friendly polite professional staff. Food presentation was found to be outstanding. I would recommend this venue for something special or to complete a theatre night out.
916;I shan't repeat my previous musings on this place as it is a staple of excellent service, clubby ambiance and delicious food. However the Summer Menu available for both lunch and dinner - 3 courses £32 is absolutely worth taking advantage of while it lasts.
917;Everything about Wiltons puts it in a class of its own. Of course it's expensive, but the TT offer is excellent value.
918;The staff in Wiltons are literally unbelievable. They make the restaurant what it is. Extremely charming and very attentive without being intrusive. I felt things were a little rushed but the food was superb and the setting amazing!
919;We visited this retaurant, which would normally be far too expensive, on a special offer. The service was excellent, the menu for the special offer had four really interesting and delicious options for each course (normally restaurant's offers do not give you as many delicious options), and when served the food was par excellence. One of our friends had a birthday and this was a wonderful way of celebrating with her, it couldn't have been better.
920;A friend and I took advantage of the summer set menu special offer (£28 for 2 courses and a cocktail, £32 for three). The service was exceptional from the moment we entered and we were never made to feel uncomfortable/inferior for being on the cheap option even though many other diners were clearly regulars. Food was perfectly cooked and there was a reasonable amount of choice on the set menu. We'll be back!
921;Cannot find a thing to complain about.
922;"Succumbed to the blandishments of a fixed price lunch: only to find that the accompaniments (mixed salad, chips, & 2 coffees) increased the price hugely. The addition of 12 1/2% service is also to be reckoned with in a ""fixed price"" offer"
923;Excellent food and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.
924;Wiltons has always been a favorite of ours, as always it was excellent.
925;Great food and service. Although we did the 2 course top table deal we ended up spending a lot more money as we couldn't resist the oysters, sides and wine list
926;"Everything as it should be - linen , table settings etc . Delightful staff and a bit of a "" family "" feeling to the place which has to be a credit to the family who are still behind the place after so many years .Wine list on the expensive side but the quality of the wines was top class so one can't complain .A very pleasurable experience ."
927;Whilst being cosy and intimate, the tables were set so that one could discuss business in a comfortable manner.
928;High standard British traditional dining experience. Excellent atmosphere and excellent food. Service was too rushed, especially on a summer night with vacant tables. Our quiet advice to waiter that we will advise him when we decide and desire to order separate courses worked well instead of vice versa. We have enjoyed Wilton's for the last 15 years and will return.
929;There's something really relaxing about the venue, the staff are ultra professional but warm, and the food excellent - it avoids food pyrotechnics and focuses on doing every dish extremely well - always a good balance of flavours. We went on the summer menu - which we were told changes every week and is on for the remainder of the summer. This is good value at £32 for 3 courses and a bellini but you'll end up spending more because you'll probably want a couple of sides with the main courses (the sides were excellent - rich, pureed peas, gratin dauphinoise and a delicious tomato salad). I went with my girlfriend on a warm summer's day but the air conditioning was set just right, nice and cooling without being too cold. All in all excellent.
930;Delightful evening at Wiltons. Recommend the scallops and the raspberry soufflé with lemon curd ice cream. Very expensive but sitting in one of the booths with an old friend is special. Excellent service
931;It was a perfect dining experience--fresh, delicious food, artfully prepared and served, in a quiet atmosphere. Staff were exceptionally attentive without being intrusive. Just perfect for American and British friends celebrating our time together.
932;I can't get enough of this venue. just amazing food. During this visit i ordered Oyster for my starter and Omelette for my main course and it was superb. The mash potatoes with truffle is to die for. slightly pricey but really love the place it's amazing.
933;As usual Wiltons was up to its normal standards, the service and friendliness of the staff were excellent and the food of good quality.
934;Think we dropped the average age by about 20 years and clearly full of a lot of regulars but that I think just sets this place apart and is its charm.Fantastic food and lovely service and the world rather slows down once you walk through the door which can only be a good thing
935;"With the ambience of a traditional private club, beautifully decorated, impeccable service and classic british food, Wilton's really is a treat. Unfortunately, not being landed gentry, the a la carte menu is a bit out of my price range, however the pre-theatre menu (5:30 - 6:30pm) is pretty reasonable. You are treated with respect and courteousness no matter what you are planning to spend. Consommé to start followed by chicken; all of a quality you would expect. The cheeseboard was a treat - the trolley comes to your table and the selection is absolutely British - cheddars, blues and goats cheeses. Perfect!"
936;Absolutely fantastic at a price that is commensurate to it's high standards
937;It is one of those places where you have always meant to visit and now nearly 70 I did.It is what a resturant should be - well prepared food with service to match, quiet and calm enough to be able to hold a conversation without screaming to be heard - it might just be an age thing - not cutting edge - dried seaweed on a foam of something undigestable - but this is what dining out should be like
938;"A very traditional restaurant, but a little gem of a place tucked away in Jermyn Street. The ambiance is a bit ""old school"" and the clientele aged 50+, and indeed there were several grandfathers and possibly great-grandfathers dining! Has the feel of a gentleman's club and a bit ""pipe and slippers"", but I have to say that despite this, I enjoyed the experience. The service was outstanding, the staff courteous, and the seafood well prepared. Where it falls down is on value. Portion size is small for the price, and I think Scotts and J Sheekey offer slightly more value in the way of quality seafood."
939;food excellent, glass of Chablis & Bordeaux was good, had the fixed price lunch - very good value
940;Everything about Wiltons is good. Excellent menu with many choices, good wine list, attentive service, quiet atmosphere.Always try to go on a visit to London
941;Wiltons is great, the food is extremely well cooked if unoriginal, the cadre is elegant and lovely, the service attentive. It gets minus points for engaging in that disagreeable modern practice of waiters filling your glasses at every possible moment and coping not as smoothly and efficiently as expected when full. It is also a bit too expensive for what it serves. Overall however a piece of old England that needs to be preserved and nurtured.
942;We really enjoyed dining at Wilton's. Food, service, ambiance were excellent and among the best we're ever experienced. Many thanks to the staff who made our experience that much more enjoyable.
943;Impressive dining room and service, however food was a little basic but cooked very well
944;"Must have eaten here 50+ times & never been disappointed. Service always exceptional, food delicious tho never ""high flown"" - thank goodness. This is my favourite restaurant, ideal for the over 50s who want to eat well, in comfort with good acoustics & marvellous staff"
945;"Wiltons is my favorite restaurant in the world. My only regret is that it's closed weekends, so I have to arrange London visits to be there on a Friday night. Superb food, ridiculous levels of service (lavish but not obseqious). My only ambition is to be the object of a conversation between the maitre d' and a client taht I overheard while waiting for my table this Friday night: ""for you, Mrs. __________ there is always a table available at Wilton's."""
946;Fast service, good english food, very nice traditional atmosphere.
947;You can use too many words to say a simple fact - Wilton's has remained at the top of the tree for many years for good reason - the food, service, ambience, wine are all excellent. Nothing more to say, really - it was lovely and memorable.
948;One of the best restaurants in London in many ways. It was our second visit this year and we will return soon!PS: Never leave the wonderful desserts untouched!
949;Loved the food and the service was great!
950;Everything you would hope for in an elegant, English restaurant. Wonderful, warm service, excellent local faire in a gracious, traditional setting.
951;The ambience at Wilton's is akin to a Gentleman’s Club. The menu is sufficiently extensive and the quality of the food is excellent. But the service is among the best that I have experienced. Attention to detail is clearly important to Wilton’s.I and my colleague were first seated at a banquette, which I particularly dislike. On asking if it would be possible to move to a table with two chairs we were immediately taken to another table. The change was effected with great good grace and simple, quiet efficiency.The only downside to Wilton’s is the eye watering size of the bill. The set menu, however, gives much better value for money.I am pleased to highly recommend this restaurant.
952;atmosphere....good food...good wine....good service
953;It remains my favorite restaurant in London. The food and service are second to none!
954;Lovely, intimate and small - get a booth!
955;Lunch with an old friend and colleague... Excellent fish as always, good wines, first class unobtrusive service, all qualities and values unchanged for many years
956;We had dinner with business associates on Friday night and thoroughly enjoyed our evening. The food and wine were delicious and the service was excellent: personable, professional, friendly but not intrusive.
957;Most selections excellent, especially watercress beet goat cheese salad. Elegant place.
958;Food and service top class. Huge mark up on wines is the only downer.
959;Great food, great venue.. The food was fresh and the service was good and attentive. I would return again when i am in the area. I really loved the mashed potatoes with truffles it was very tasty.I can't wait to visit again to try out their dessert menu.
960;It is impossible to fault Wilton's at the moment – everything was just perfect – especially the food and service (including the sommelier who was very responsive and imaginative). We had the sole which was probably the best sole I’ve eaten – ever.
961;This restaurant was recommended to us by people we met on holiday, who have been going to Wiltons for years. It was an absolute treat. We had the set menu as it included what we were going to choose anyway. We had the recommendation of the day which was a russian salmon dish encased in pastry, which came with lovely veg and my Husband said the best ever potatoes, it was simply outstanding. Included in the set menu was 3 courses and 2 glasses of wine, which was exceptional value for money.Definitely will go back.
962;I'd prefer to say genteel, the service and ambience could be miscontrued as a bit stuffy. The food is really prepared and served well, our all seafood dishes were done just perfectly!
963;First time to Wiltons and it won't be my last. The staff were very attentive. I requested to move to a more private table for a business lunch and they were more than accommodating. The food was brilliant and could not be faulted. A wonderful experience.
964;We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Wiltons. The food and service was excellent and special attention was given to one of our party who had special dietory requirements. We look forward to dining at Wiltons in the nearer future
965;excellent fresh sea food served in traditional surroundings - service very good
966;You know where you stand with Wiltons. Great food, and excellent service. It's pretty expensive - but worth it for special occasions. I'll be back for sure
967;"With its wood panelled walls, trolley service and pinafore wearing staff, Wiltons' clubby vibe may not be to everyone's tastes but, if you are looking for a suitably grand, ""old school"" venue in the West End, it fits the bill perfectly. The average age of our dining companions was 65+ but I viewed that as testament to the enduring appeal of the venue as opposed to a damning indication of their ability to attract a younger demographic. All in all, a good find."
968;We highly recommend Wiltons for a night out in London. Looking forwardfor our next trip to London.
969;Nice to visit a restaurant with truly traditional values.
970;The food here was amazing, and the staff could not have been friendlier. We had the taster menu, which apparently they only ran because we had requested it specifically (we were in the middle of the Olympics). Definitely agree with other reviewers that this felt like a throwback to the British Colonial days - you could imagine the other diners making decisions of national importance over their beef. Bit old fashioned, but charming and we had a great meal.
971;Lovely and fresh, but expensive
972;"We arrived on time for our 7 p.m. reservation and found we were starting unfashionably early. However, we received very attentive service throughout the evening, and by the time we left, the place was full. No sophisticated diners will find menu choices to be surprising or new; however, the preparation and quality of the food could not be faulted. Particularly good were the appetizer terrine of fois gras, and dover sole. It was an expensive but lovely dinner."
973;This was supposed to be a nice restaurant but we thought that our seafood entrees werelacking flavor. It seemed as if they rushed our order. The wine list couldbe improved by adding some California cabs. The wine list had an abundance ofmediocre French merlots and whites many of which were way overpriced for theirquality. The service was attentive but the entire restaurant was overheated to thetemperature of 26 degrees Celsius. Not the best environment for an expensive dinner.
974;This was the first of many visits. We just loved the outstanding service, food and surroundings.
975;Excellent food and services again.  It was a small dinner celebration for my wife's birthday, and the waiters are so friendly that my wife was truly impressed.
976;We had an intimate dinner for two at Wiltons on Jermyn Street to celebrate my b-day. Everything was amazing. Service, food, environment!!! Strongly, strongly recommended for an traditional dinner in the heart of Mayfair. Note: Jacket required.
977;A superb venue, exemplary service, and utterly delicious food.  Nice glass of chilled champagne on the TT deal.  Good selection of wines (not cheap - £62 for an excellent SA White.  Charming staff who really do make you feel special.  We would not hesitate to return and this will become one of our regular haunts.  Our guests really loved it and they did a special plate to celebrate a birthday and anniversary.  It is not cheap - but worth every penny.  Excellent.
978;Exceptional food and service
979;Wiltons on Jermyn Street is amazing! Sooo delicious & oh so British old school. The smoked salmon is to die for but everything is so fresh & delicous!

983;ONE OF THE QUICKEST SERVICES I EVER HAVE HAD EVEN IF IT WAS ALL FISH. EXCELLENT FOOD
984;What a super lunch deal at Wiltons the TT £45 for 3 courses and wine, mineral water and even coffee is. Excellent venue with cracking service which under normal circumstances would be very expensive.

990;well prepared food and excellent service
991;Very old school and not easy on the wallet, however, service second to none and the food is delicious. We had seafood salad which was staggeringly good followed by a traditional Xmas meal, where the turkey was perfect.
992;Consistently good food and good service.  Will always go back.
993;Fantastic, 'old-school' dining experience at Wilton's (but in a good way).  This place is perfect for a special occasion.
994;Wiltons, Jermyn Street was again a wonderful experience. Always try to make this our regular Christmas venue. We had the Turner menu which didn't disappoint. Wonderful food and wine and a great atmosphere. A delightful evening which you wished would not end. Will definitely go again.
995;Service was entertaining and professional.  Our server was a colorful character!  Food was very good, especially the different types of oysters.  Quite an interesting and loyal clientele.  Our table was at the bar, and I wonder if I called directly, would I have gotten a better table instead of booking online?  In any case, it was a great night out.  Will certainly return, although it will hurt the pocketbook...
996;Four of us had an excellent lunch at Wiltons in Jermyn Street, London.  Food and service both excellent. Only downside was that it was fairly full, so the background noise level was quite high.
997;The food was artistically presented and was equally delicious. The atmosphere was elegant and extremely comfortable. A distinctive 'traditional' feel without being fusty or unwelcoming. Would highly recommend.
998;Wiltons in Jermyn Street is consistently good and today was no exception. Excellent food, fine wine and polite, attentive service that was not over-bearing. All four of our party had the salmon coulibiac from thr trolley - amazing! Will definitely return.
999;Fantastic tasting menu. Strict jacket policy. Very expensive! We payed more than 450 pounds for 3 of us.
1000;Great luhchtime institution.  Very traditional, great service and excellent food.  Would highly recommend although quite pricey.
1001;The food and wine were great and the staff are delightful - very attentive without being intrusive but it is very expensive.
1002;Wiltons is an institution and did not disappoint
1003;Wiltons, London.  Excellent evening. Tables a little too close together and I was refused a booth when they were clearly available.
1004;Wiltons, Jermyn Street, LondonWe arrived over an hour late due to traffic, and our table was still there.  The staff were attentive without being overbearing, even to the point of offering a different chair to one of our party which would be more comfortable to sit in.  The menu was excellent, although a few selections had run out by the time we ordered.  The waiter was knowledgeable about wines - very helpful.  An excellent and memorable evening, and a venue to which we will return.
1005;Excellent ambience and food. Good service
1006;This was strangely my first visit to Wiltons in Jermyn St, SW1, I have to say that it was absolutely first class. From our greeting to the time that we left you could not but be impressed by the ambience, the menu and the service. I will be booking my next table very soon.
1007;Wiltons, LondonA delightful find, combining the best of British tradition but very unstuffy.  Cosy and lovely old-fashioned decor without the gloom.  The service is charming and attentive, but not over the top.  We had perfectly cooked plaice from a menu which is dominated by fish, and some slightly overrated strawberries and a very acceptable brulee with rhubarb.  The wine list is somewhat expensive - a half bottle at £26, but will definitely return as the dining experience worth it.
1008;Wiltons is one of the great restaurants in the heart of London.  The food is excellent and so is the service.  We made use of the sommelier to recommend wine to go with the food. A really good experience. We will go again.
1009;Wiltons on Jermyn Street is a real winner if you want a very classy venue with excellent service and a great menu especially for Fish and seafood lovers.
1010;Wiltons in St James London for lunch. Excellent set lunch in a gentlemans club setting .
1011;Dinner at Wiltons was OK but nothing special. We to the fish options for starters and mains and these were reasonably well executed. Desserts were average and expensive. The overall impression is that the bill was a bit rich for the combination of food and service. There was nothing wrong with the experience, it just wasn't quite good enough to justify the cost.
1012;Visited Wiltons in London after hearing good reports. Very traditional English atmosphere. The food was excellent but the table (for2) was tiny and we felt was in the corridor between the front and back of the restaurant in order to get more tables in.
1013;"Wiltons, London was a pleasant change from the loud noisy eateries we often have to endure. Food was excellent; classic, very tasty, no-nonsense. Service was attentive and politely friendly. Didn't realise jackets were required but my husband was offered a Cerruti - far better than any he owns."
1014;Wiltons, LondonA curious spot. The food ranges from the excellent - the oyster soup was magnificent, displaying true technical mastery - to the mismatched - the gingerbread with the foie gras demonstrated that the dish had not been tested  because whilst one might think it would work, it didn't. The pastry chef deserves a special mention as well. The ambience is old-fashioned, in an eighties way - camel paint and green velour chairs. The waitresses are dressed for matron fetishists only.
1015;I had a fine dinner by myself at Wilton's in London.  The Dover sole was one of the best I've ever had (and priced accordingly), and the crab and avocado starter was also excellent.  The service was cheerful, but also a little forgetful, which one always notices more when dining alone.
1016;Great food. Excellent service. Expensive but has always delivered for me.
1017;attentive service and good fooda perrenial favourite
1018;Wiltons, Jermyn St, Wonderful evening, excellent food and wine - its was noisy in one area due to one lady in a group of Americans, but we asked to move and were accommodated immediately. All staff were excellent, the service was first class we will definitely return. Well done
1019;A truly memorable dining destination!  In this day and age of trendy restaurants, celebrity chefs and over the top exposure to the art of eating, it is so satisfying to enoy and excellent meal, in excellent surroundings and with excellent service!Enough said.
1020;Wilton's in Piccadilly in London lived up to its traditional reputation and we were served in a professional French style.  The food was lovely and used high quality ingredients and correspondingly not cheap.  However worth it for the treat!
1021;I and a collegue dined at Wiltons in Jermyn Street, London. It was sensational in every way: the staff are amazing,the ambience unique, the food exquisite, and an experience to be treasured.
1022;Wiltons was a rare and wonderful experience.  My companion was lent a jacket on arrival - this is one of only 2 restaurants in London where a jacket is required.  The atmosphere was of hushed reverence, and rightly so, as the food was superb, the service faultless.  Overall a superb evening with generous portions of exquisitely cooked food.  Definitely worth a return visit but for me, would need to be on the back of another offer, as the ordinary menu was pricey.
1023;Wiltons is an amazing experience the food, the staff, the ambience.A real treat can't wait to go back.
1024;Excellent for a corporate busines lunch, will definitely visit again.
1025;Wiltons is a wonderful experience, from the minute you walk in to the minute you leave.  The food, the staff and the ambience all top class.  Can't wait to go back.
1026;"Wilton's in London is one of the worst we have visited in a long  time. Their website suggested great things. However, despite a pleasant and traditional interior which felt relaxing to begin with, the whole  experience was ruined by an over-zealous and pretentious waiter whose aim in  life was to ""sell"" the most expensive items on the menu, using a style and phraseology that was frankly nauseus! Interuptions were frequent, food badly cooked, and value was atrocious! Will never go back!"
1027;Wiltons in St James'....very expensive but an extraordinary dining experience.Had the Turner tasting menu. Each course was excellent.  Worth it for special occasions.
1028;Wiltons: The best restaurant in London to go to when it really matters.
1029;Wiltons in Jermyn street is a very pleasant location with very pleasant food
1030;Expensive but mostly worth it.  Excellent quality ingredients: Oysters, Dover Sole and Woodcock.  Food is served unadorned by sauces etc. Stick with the traditional English Puds.Nice service and very civilised atmosphere.
1031;Wiltons in Jermyn Street - good food, excellent service, nice and friendly. This is truly a super experience.  would definitely recommend.
1032;Very enjoyable business dinner at Wiltons in Jermyn Street, I would definitly go back again.  Top quality seafood.
1033;Excellent food and service. Seafood here is amazing
1034;Wiltons in London is a great place to meet up for lunch, if you want that little bit extra that Mayfair is known for. Excellent food and service.
1035;Wiltons - Fantastic service and simple food which allows the flavours of the food to shine through
1036;Wiltons in Jermyn Street - good food, excellent service, nice and friendly. This is truly my home away from home. I recommend it.
1037;Super experience
1038;excellent as ever
1039;Wiltons is rather special. We arrived 24 hours early but were still treated superbly.Food is delicious rather than fussy. My lobster coxtail was 95% lobster amazing. My wife loved her potted shrimps and Veal. I had a mixed grill first time for years and loved it. Not cheap but you get what you pay for.
1040;I had lunch at Wiltons twice during this trip to London. I found this gem by coincidence and I'm glad I did. Delicious food, fantastic service, and great ambience. It's like a gentlemen's club and already after just a couple of visits you're known to the staff and that gives a whole new dimension to the visit. I loved it and I will be back for more. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends for sure.
1041;The food was cold which detracted greatly from the evening, with overseas guests.Not likely to return.
1042;There's something very reassuring about Wilton's, even 18 months into the credit crunch. Ordering the grilled Dover sole may be a bit of a cliche, but it's the best I have ever tasted.
1043;Enjoyed good ambience and excellent services very much but did not really enjoy the quality of foods and the bill. My partner's first and second main course choices were not available and it was a bit disappointing.  Bentley's perhaps serves better foods at 2/3 of the prices.
1044;Wiltons is the quintessential British restaurant.  Excellent low key service, superb food, and delightful atmosphere. Patrick, Michael, and Barbara all contribute to a perfect London evening meal.
1045;Prepare to travel back in time... at least where the decor is concerned. The interior brings one back to the glorious days of the empire, as you dine with political and business bigwigs. The food is classic British done to a high standard and the service is impeccable. Shame about the formal wear, but it does add to the ambiance.
1046;Excellent, as always!May think of installing some heating in the washrooms:)
1047;"This really is  an ""establishment"" restaurant. I'm sure I should have recognised some of the people in there too. However, whilst the ingredients are obviously is of an extremely high standard, the presentation is a bit lacking, especially given the price.  My glass of wine was forgotten about too, even though they apologised profusely for it."
1048;Wiltons is old school dining - just what you need for a business meeting although slightly on the pricey side.  Good for fish eaters.
1049;Wilton's is evrything a very top restaurant should be:  friendly and welcoming, impeccable service, excellent food beautifully presented and in decent quantities.  Downsides -  only one and that depends if you mind paying 100 plus a head.
1050;Excellant quality of food and wine, pricey but worth it for that important client.
1051;Wiltons is an English restaurant at its best. Although a little pricey the food was great and all enjoyed themselves. My only recommendation would to add a veg  option to the menu.
1052;Wilton's is one of our favorite London restaurants.  Service is consistently excellent, the wine beautiful, and the food delicious.  We entertain colleagues, friends, and family at Wilton's....everyone has immensely enjoyed themselves.
1053;Wiltons is an excellent restaurant with great food and an extensive wine list to match. The seafood is wonderful and the meat is even better (to me anyway!). The prices is excessive but rarely do all four diners have such glowing reports of the food so I have to recommend this restaurant to those who can afford it.
1054;We had a very enjoyable lunch at Wiltons, it is an excellent place to hold a business lunch
1055;Wiltons deliberately projects an old-fashioned image, but there is nothing old-fashioned about the quality of the food and service. I had a generous plate of excellent smoked eel to start, a great casserole of venison followed by a savoury of welsh rarebit as a 'pudding'.They do game in season and selection of fish dishes - Sole, Halibut, Wild Turbot etc. All together a very nice restaurant for a treat!
1056;An expensive evening but you do not normally get quality at this level without paying appropriately. The food and wine were excelent - the staff are very user frriendly and genuinely provide service. Nothing seems to be too much trouble. My guest, who was from abroad, was delighted by the old world ambience and the old world courtesies. I will certainly continue to be an enthusiastic patron.GD
1057;This a traditional venue where the food, service and ambience combine to give an atmosphere of old world charm which is hard to find these days - I and my guests were delighted by the way we were received and looked after - the food was simple abut elegant and we will undoubtedly return again - not cheap but nevertheless very good value for money as a social and culinary experience.GD
1058;Wiltons is so very typical of a long established London restaurant, very conscious of its history with a menu that remains conservative. The atmosphere is friendly but reserved with a clientele that appears dominated by business and corporate. However a distinctly  refined place that clearly also caters for women who wish to dine well and relax with friends . Remember that men cannot dine without a jacket, a warning for those with limited wardrobes or on a tourist budget. Great dining!
1059;Pricey but excellent
1060;Wiltons is a classic. Food is excellent and pretty good value. It's the comprehensive wine list that damages the wallet
1061;Expensive but worth every penny.
1062;Everything about Wiltons restaurant is excellent.  My guest and I were made to feel very welcome and had a wonderful lunch.  Looking forward to visiting the restaurant again in the near future.  Thank you to all at Wiltons.
1063;Wiltons lives up to its reputation for good traditional English food and everything was as it should be - given that it is not cheap.  It could do with a few reasonably priced bottles of wine on the list.  There is virtually nothing under £30 a bottle.
1064;Wiltons is a fantastic all round dining experience. Perfect in every way. Its a little expensive (oh and gentlemen must wear a jacket) but that can be the only complaint. Quintessentially English!
1065;Wilton's provides excellent seafood at stratospheric prices with matron like service and some guidance to go for the most expensive things. If you resist, a very good meal indeed can be had in fairly relaxed surroundingsfor about £120 per person.
1066;Wilton's restaurant, Jermyn St, LondonGlass of champagne was flat, but sommelier swapped it without too much fuss tho' only after telling me Bolly wasnt always fizzy! A little old school and forcing my partner, who looked smart enough, to wear someone else's jacket, I thought went out with the dinosaur - I bet if Mick Jagger walked in in a T-shirt they wouldnt ask him to put s.o. else's dusty jacket on.  Food was excellent however and service attentive although a little pressured at times.
1067;Wiltons has a homely, welcoming but conservative atmosphere. The staff were attentive, helpful and yet discrete. I felt that the tables were a little too close together however I expect that is understandable in a restaurant that is popular and full on the evening we ate. This raised the noise level and to some extent intruded. The food and particularly the drinks especially digestifs was very expensive. I think that for a three course meal, wine digestifs and coffee it could come to £150pp.
1068;We had excellent meal at Wilton's.  Very efficient friendly service, good seafood.  We really enjoyed our lunch there and would go back.
1069;Dined at Wiltons Restaurant last night for my husbands birthday.  Service, food and drinks exceptional.  My only quibble -  I was a little surprised to have our food order taken before our drinks order.  Apart from this Wiltons is a wonderful, but breathtakingly expensive venue for a special occasion.
1070;excellent but very expensive
1071;Wiltons - great food, great service, great location.  Rather expensive but well worth it for a special treat / business lunch.
1072;Yesterday was my very first visit to Wiltons, however I will most definately be returning. As soon as you walk in you are instantly made to feel at home, the restuarant has the feel of a comfortable pair of shoes. Both the food & service were exceptionally good, as was the individual bread basket placed ont he table. My gazpatico & lambs kidneys with bacon were both sublime. I rouned off my meal with a very good double esspresso & some of the best peti foies that I've tasted in a long while.
1073;Although expensive we had a very pleasant evening with friends.  Would definitely recommend for special occasions
1074;wonderful night out with the family.  staff treated us as if we were regulars.  while not a bargain, the food is trad british and of impeccable quality.  would definitely go again.
1075;Was absolutely amazing.  Couldn't fault anything.The staff were as gorgeous as the food!
1076;As many staff as diners: everywhere waiters with trays. Thus very attentive service which may explain the breathtaking prices. However food and cooking both very good & overall a worthwhile evening.
1077;Wiltons is an institution of fine dining 'old school' style. Wilton's gives all the prententious style-restaurants a master class on how to host an impeccable meal like old friends.
1078;Very good with good service but thought the food was a bit overpriced - £50 for some lobster and rice did not portray good value for money.
1079;Magnificient and expensive but it is a real experience to be taken back to yesteryear.  You get what you pay for.  The small butter cookies are delicious.
1080;Excellent ambience. You get what you pay for!
1081;Food and service excellent.  A lovely restaurant.
